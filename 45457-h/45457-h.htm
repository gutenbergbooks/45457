<p>"There's a young lady here to see you,
Linda," announced Miss Emily Carlton, coming
into her niece's room the morning after the
latter's return from the St. Louis Ground
School. The girl had just graduated, winning
both commercial and transport licenses, and, besides
that, she was registered as the only feminine
airplane mechanic in the country.</p>

<p>"Who is she, Auntie?" inquired Linda, rubbing
her eyes and peering out the window into
the lovely June sunshine. What a wonderful
day! Too beautiful to spend on the ground! But
she sighed as she recalled that at the moment
she did not possess a plane.</p>

<p>"A reporter, I believe," replied the older
woman. "Miss Hawkins, from the 'News'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I haven't done anything to get into the
newspapers," objected Linda.</p>

<p>"My dear child, you don't have to! Aren't
you the only girl who ever flew the Atlantic
alone? That's enough to keep you in the spotlight
forever."</p>

<p>"But I don't like spot-lights," Linda insisted,
starting to dress. "Couldn't you get rid
of her, Auntie?"</p>

<p>Miss Carlton shook her head.</p>

<p>"I tried to, dear. But she wouldn't go. She
wants to know your summer plans. I told her
you'd probably just spend a quiet vacation with
me at Green Falls, where we were last year. But
she didn't believe me. She said you weren't the
type to take your vacations quietly."</p>

<p>Linda laughed.</p>

<p>"I guess she's right, Aunt Emily."</p>

<p>The latter looked troubled. She had been trying
for a year&mdash;ever since Linda's father had
given her an Arrow Pursuit bi-plane for graduation&mdash;to
keep the girl out of the air as much
as possible, but she had not succeeded. The
Carltons were comfortably well-off, and it was
Miss Carlton's wish that Linda go in for society,
and make a good marriage. But though
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Linda enjoyed occasional parties as much as
any normal young person, she had a serious
purpose in life, to make flying her career just
as a young man would.</p>

<p>"You won't go to Green Falls&mdash;with all the
rest of the crowd?" asked Miss Carlton, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I can't, Aunt Emily. I&mdash;I&mdash;can't spare the
time. I am trying to get a job."</p>

<p>"A job? But you don't need money. Your
father's business is dong nicely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't the money I want," interrupted
the girl. "It's the experience."</p>

<p>Linda finished dressing and came down stairs
to meet the young woman who was waiting for
her. The latter insisted that she eat her breakfast
while they talked.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I haven't done a thing interesting
to the world since my ocean flight!" Linda
said. "Except win my licenses, and all the graduates'
names have already been listed in the
papers."</p>

<p>The reporter smiled at her as if she were a
child.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," she explained, "you are
front-page news now, no matter what you do.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
You are Queen of the Air, and will be until some
other woman does something more daring than
your flight to Paris alone. So everything you
do interests the public. Naturally they want to
know what you are planning for the summer.
Flying to South America, or Alaska? And what
kind of plane do you intend to buy next, since
you sold your Bellanca in Paris?"</p>

<p>Linda yawned, and fingered her mail&mdash;a great
pile of letters beside her plate. Invitations,
mostly from the younger set in Spring City,
for she was very popular.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't know yet," she replied,
simply.</p>

<p>"Maybe if you read your mail&mdash;" suggested
the reporter.</p>

<p>"She is to be a bridesmaid at Miss Katherine
Clavering's wedding next week," supplied Miss
Carlton, entering the dining-room. As usual,
social events were all-important to her, especially
affairs with the Claverings, the richest
people in Spring City. Katherine, or "Kitty,"
as her friends all called her, was to be married
to Lt. Hulbert of the U. S. Flying Corps, and
her brother Ralph made no secret of his devotion
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for Linda. If he had had his way, they
would have been married last Christmas, and
aviation jobs would be out of the question for
Linda Carlton at the present time.</p>

<p>The girl searched through her mail rapidly,
and picked out a letter which interested her
above all others. It was from the Pitcairn Autogiro
Company in the East.</p>

<p>As she read it, her blue eyes lighted up with
enthusiasm, and she examined the enclosed circular
with excited interest, completely forgetting
her visitor.</p>

<p>The reporter waited patiently for a minute
or two.</p>

<p>"Well, what's it all about, Miss Carlton?"
she finally inquired.</p>

<p>Linda looked up at her as if she were startled,
and suddenly remembered her caller. She
handed her the circular.</p>

<p>"I am going to buy an autogiro," she announced,
with decision.</p>

<p>"A what?" demanded her aunt, thinking
Linda referred to some kind of automobile. "A
new car?"</p>

<p>The reporter smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"A flying bug?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Miss Carlton gasped in horror. A bug! What
would her niece be up to next?</p>

<p>"Linda!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It's a plane, Aunt Emily," the girl explained.
"You ought to like it. It's the very
safest kind there is. In the eight or nine years
since it was invented, nobody has been killed
with one."</p>

<p>Miss Carlton looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"No airplane is safe," she remarked.</p>

<p>"This isn't an airplane. It's an autogiro."</p>

<p>"But it flies?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Linda showed her the picture. It was indeed
a queer looking object, with its wind-mill-like
arrangement on top, and its absence of big
wings. As the reporter had observed, its appearance
was very like a huge bug.</p>

<p>"They do say it's unusually safe," corroborated
the latter. "You'll have to take a ride in
it, Miss Carlton."</p>

<p>"Not I!" protested the older woman. "Firm
earth is good enough for me.... No, it looks
dangerous enough to me."</p>

<p>Linda smiled; she could never convince her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
aunt of the joy of flying, or of the minimum
risk, if one were a careful pilot. She was glad
that her father was more broad-minded; if he
weren't, she would still be on the ground.</p>

<p>"And where will you go with your Flying
Bug, Miss Carlton?" asked the reporter, tapping
her pencil on her note-book.</p>

<p>"Not on any long flight," replied the girl,
to her aunt's relief. "My aim is to get some
sort of aviation job."</p>

<p>"What would you like to do?"</p>

<p>"Anything connected with planes. I prefer
flying, but I'd be satisfied at the beginning with
ground work.... If you will write down your
telephone number, Miss Hawkins, I will call you
up when I have decided definitely just what my
plans will be."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much!" exclaimed the other
girl, rising. "I think you are a peach, Miss Carlton.
Some celebrities are so mean to us reporters."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm not a real celebrity," laughed
Linda. "I'll be forgotten by the public this time
next year. I sincerely hope that more and more
girls and women will be doing things in aviation,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
so that my little stunt will seem trivial.
That is progress, you know."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the visitor gone before Miss
Carlton was begging Linda to open her other
letters.</p>

<p>"The Junior League picnic is tomorrow," she
said. "And Dot Crowley is giving a luncheon
in honor of Kitty Clavering.... There are
probably a lot more things, too...."</p>

<p>Rather listlessly Linda opened her letters. It
was not the same, she thought, without Louise
to share everything. Louise Haydock&mdash;Louise
Mackay now&mdash;had been her chum all through
school, where they were so inseparable that they
were always referred to by their friends as the
"double Ls." The other girl's marriage had
meant a sharp break to Linda, for the Mackays
had moved to Wichita, Kansas, where Ted was
employed as a flyer.</p>

<p>As if Miss Carlton understood her niece's
thoughts, she remarked that Louise was coming
for Kitty's wedding.</p>

<p>Linda's eyes shone with joy.</p>

<p>"Flying?" she inquired, as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>"Yes. She and Ted are arriving some time tonight.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Mrs. Haydock called up, and asked me to
tell you."</p>

<p>Linda could not read her mail for a few minutes,
so intense was her happiness at this
splendid news.</p>

<p>"Ted can go with me to see about the autogiro!"
she exclaimed. "I do so want his opinion!"</p>

<p>"Go where?"</p>

<p>"To Philadelphia, where the Pitcairn Company
is located."</p>

<p>Again Miss Carlton looked annoyed, almost
shocked.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you'll take time to fly
to Philadelphia, with all your engagements?"</p>

<p>Linda nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll be here for the wedding, Aunt Emily.
Don't worry about that. But nothing else is
particularly important."</p>

<p>Miss Carlton groaned. What could you do
with a girl like Linda? You might as well have
a boy!</p>

<p>The mail was finally opened and sorted, and
Linda dutifully went to a dinner dance at the
Country Club that evening with Ralph Clavering.
But she was tense all evening, for she was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hoping every moment that Louise would arrive.</p>

<p>About midnight the young couple dashed in,
radiant in their happiness. To everyone's
amusement Louise flew into Linda's arms in the
middle of the dance floor.</p>

<p>"How do you get that way?" demanded
Ralph, pretending to be angry. "As if it isn't
enough to endure every fellow in the room
tapping me when I'm dancing with Linda, without
having girls do it too!"</p>

<p>But the double Ls scarcely heard him. They
were so enraptured at seeing each other again.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay a week!" announced
Louise. "Luckily, Ted has some business in
Philadelphia and New York, and he'll be flying
back and forth."</p>

<p>"Philadelphia!" exclaimed Linda. "Isn't
that great! Can we go with him there?"</p>

<p>"Of course we can, if you don't mind a
squeeze. The plane isn't very big," explained
Louise. "But then, we're not fat. Ted'll be
tickled to death to have company&mdash;he hates flying
alone. But why do you want to go to Philadelphia,
Linda?"</p>

<p>"To buy an autogiro!"</p>

<p>"You always were crazy about those things.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Remember the time you gave up a dance to fly
one?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do. And you wouldn't go with
me."</p>

<p>"Well, there was a reason," laughed Louise,
making no secret of her admiration for her
husband.... "I think Ted'll go day after tomorrow,"
she continued. "We thought we'd enjoy
resting a day, and taking in the Junior
League picnic."</p>

<p>"Fine!" agreed Linda. "That will give
everybody a chance to see you. Besides, Aunt
Emily would die if I missed that affair. Remember
the one last year. Didn't we have fun?"</p>

<p>"We certainly did," smiled Louise, reminiscently.
"But it seems like more than a year
ago&mdash;so much has happened."</p>

<p>"I wasn't even flying then," observed the
other.</p>

<p>"And I hadn't met Ted!"</p>

<p>"You're a real bride, Lou!" returned Linda,
affectionately. "But you're just the same old
dear!"</p>

<p>The following day was just as delightful as
it had been the previous year, and the picnic
another success. To Linda it was all the more
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
enjoyable, because of the novelty of seeing her
old friends again after the separation caused
by a year at the school in St. Louis.</p>

<p>Ted went along with Louise, and entered into
all the sports, just as if he had been born and
brought up with the crowd in Spring City.
Moreover, he was delighted at the prospect of
having the two girls go with him the next day,
and appeared almost as enthusiastic about the
autogiro as Linda herself.</p>

<p>The weather continued perfect, and the three
happy young people took off from Spring City
the following morning. An excellent mechanic
himself, Ted always kept his plane in tip-top
condition, and it was a rare thing indeed for
him even to encounter a minor accident. This
flight proved no exception; straight and swift
through the June skies he flew to the field outside
the city of Philadelphia where the autogiros
were on display.</p>

<p>"You really expect to buy one today, Linda?"
asked Louise, as she climbed out of the plane.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if Ted gives his approval," replied
the capable aviatrix. She had always had the
greatest confidence in this young red-haired
pilot, who had taken her on her first flight, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
who had saved her and his wife from disaster
upon two occasions.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that it can go fast enough to
suit you, Linda?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"It can travel a hundred and twenty-five
miles an hour, and that ought to satisfy me. If
I were entering any air-races, I'd want a special
racing plane anyhow, for the occasion. But I'm
not going out for races. I want to take a job, and
I think an autogiro will be the most convenient
plane I can have, to take with me anywhere I
want to go. I shan't have to depend on big fields
for landing."</p>

<p>"Right-o," agreed the young man.</p>

<p>They walked across the field and were shown
a model by an enthusiastic salesman. As the
reporter had said, it did look like a flying bug,
with its odd wind-mill-like rotor on top, and its
small stub-like wings, which were there mainly
to mount the lateral controls or ailerons.</p>

<p>"It isn't so pretty as the Arrow," remarked
Louise.</p>

<p>"Handsome is as handsome does," returned
Linda. "If we'd had an autogiro that time in
Canada, when our gas leaked out, a forced landing
wouldn't have been disastrous."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the rotor takes care of that, after
the engine is dead," explained Linda. "An autogiro
can come down vertically at a slower rate
than we did with our parachutes."</p>

<p>"I'll never forget how scared I was that time
we jumped off," remarked her companion.
"You know, it's one thing to see other people
do it&mdash;in the air, or at the movies&mdash;and its something
else to step off into space yourself. That
all-gone feeling!"</p>

<p>"I don't mind it any more now&mdash;it doesn't
seem any worse than dropping ten stories in an
elevator. But I know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Well, I have never had to jump since,"
Louise informed her. "But," she continued as
they walked around the autogiro, "isn't there
really any danger of crashing?"</p>

<p>"You can crash, of course," laughed Linda.
"If you steer straight for another plane, or a
tree. But tail-spins are practically impossible;
they say no matter what happens the autogiro
settles to the ground like a tired hen. It's the
principle of centrifugal force&mdash;it can't fail."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah?" remarked Louise, hiding a
yawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"What I want your opinion on, Ted," added
Linda, turning to the young man, "is the engine.
You know more about engines than I do."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that last," he replied,
modestly. "Looks O.K. to me&mdash;I've been examining
it while you girls chattered."</p>

<p>The salesman, who had been listening to the
conversation, suddenly burst into a smile. He
had been wondering where he had seen that girl
before. Now he knew! Her pictures had been in
every newspaper in the country. She was Linda
Carlton, of course!</p>

<p>"You're Miss Carlton, aren't you?" he demanded,
excitedly. "The girl who flew to Paris
alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Linda, indifferently. She
didn't want to talk ancient history now. "This
is a P C A&mdash;2, isn't it?" she inquired, to bring
the man to the subject of autogiros.</p>

<p>"Yes. Fifteen thousand dollars. I suppose it's
not necessary to tell <i>you</i> what instruments it is
equipped with&mdash;an experienced flyer like yourself
can recognize them by a glance into the
pilot's cock-pit."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see them. And I had a circular besides....
It's complete, all right. The only
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
thing I don't like about it is the separate passenger's
cock-pit. My Arrow Pursuit had a
companion cock-pit."</p>

<p>"You can always talk to your passenger
through the speaking-tube," the salesman reminded
her.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And nobody you take along now-a-days will
be as talkative as I always was on our trips together,"
Louise observed, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Talkative!" repeated Linda, "All you ever
wanted to do was sleep! Every time I looked
at you on that flight to Canada, you were peacefully
dozing!"</p>

<p>"And she still has a bad habit of dropping
off," teased Ted.</p>

<p>"So long as that's the only way I 'drop off,'
I'm satisfied," concluded Louise.</p>

<p>In spite of their frivolous talk, Linda had been
thinking seriously about the autogiro, and had
entirely made up her mind about it.</p>

<p>"I'll take it," she announced. "If you surely
approve of it, Ted."</p>

<p>"I do, absolutely."</p>

<p>The salesman looked at her in amazement.
Never had he made such an easy sale before.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
But he did not meet people like Linda Carlton
every day!</p>

<p>"Don't you want to try it out?" he suggested.
"I can show you how to fly it in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"I have flown one before," she told him. "But
I would like to take it up for a few minutes if
you don't mind. Am I to have this particular
one? I have a certified check in payment."</p>

<p>The salesman blinked his eyes in further consternation.
The check right there, the girl ready
to take the plane home with her! It was a moment
before he could catch his breath.</p>

<p>"Of course," he finally managed to answer.
"I'll have her started for you immediately.
And&mdash;would your friends care to go up with
you?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" exclaimed Ted. "We're your best
friends, aren't we, Linda? So oughtn't we to be
privileged with the first ride?"</p>

<p>"You certainly are!" replied the famous
aviatrix, squeezing Louise's hand in her excitement
and delight. "Come on!"</p>

<p>It was the Mackays' first flight in an autogiro,
and though they were very much crowded
in the passenger's cock-pit, they insisted that
that only added to the fun. With a sureness
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
which Ted watched in admiration, Linda took
off and flew round and round the field, putting
the new plane through all sorts of tests, proving
conclusively that all the claims for it were
well-founded.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later they came slowly down
to earth, landing on the exact spot from which
Linda had taken off.</p>

<p>"Unscramble yourselves!" she cried to her
passengers, as she climbed out of the cock-pit.
"Let's go pay our bill."</p>

<p>"She's great, Linda!" approved Louise, as
her husband helped her out. "I'm for her, even
if she is a funny-looking bug."</p>

<p>"Sh!" cautioned Linda, solemnly. "You
might hurt her feelings. She's&mdash;she's&mdash;a lady!"</p>

<p>"Ladybug!" exclaimed Louise, with a sudden
burst of inspiration.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Ladybug is right!" agreed her chum enthusiastically.
"You've named her for me,
Lou!"</p>

<i>The Aviation Job</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>"It's marvelous!" exclaimed Linda, as the
salesman came to meet her after her test-flight
in the autogiro. "Will you have her filled with
gas and oil, while I sign the contract? I'll take
her with me."</p>

<p>The salesman smiled at Ted Mackay.</p>

<p>"In the same way any other woman would
buy a hat," he remarked, to Louise's amusement.</p>

<p>"You found it easy to fly, Miss Carlton?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" she replied. "So simple that
a child could almost do it! It certainly is the
plane of the future, or of the present, I should
say."</p>

<p>"We'll probably see one perched on everybody's
roof within the next five years," teased
Louise, although in reality she shared her
chum's admiration for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>While the mechanics gave the autogiro a
thorough inspection, the little group strolled to
the office to sign the papers and to meet the
president of the company.</p>

<p>The salesman introduced Mr. Pitcairn, and
added, proudly, "This is <i>the</i> Miss Carlton, of
world-wide fame! The only woman who ever
flew the Atlantic alone! And I have had the
honor, to sell Miss Carlton an autogiro!"</p>

<p>Linda blushed as she shook hands, and her
eyelids fluttered in embarrassment. She could
never get used to public admiration. Immediately
she began to talk about her new possession.</p>

<p>"I want it for every-day flying," she explained.
"I think it will be wonderful for that."</p>

<p>"We believe that it is," agreed the older
man. "And we are honored indeed, Miss Carlton,
that you have chosen it. It will be a feather
in our cap."</p>

<p>"Miss Carlton never thinks of things like
that," remarked Louise. "But I guess we're
glad that she doesn't!"</p>

<p>While Linda signed the necessary papers,
and handed her check to the salesman, the president
inquired what her plans included now that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
she had graduated from the Ground School with
such success.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know," she replied. "I want
to get some kind of aviation job&mdash;I am more
interested in the use of planes in every-day
life than I am in races and spectacular events,
though I understand that these have their place.
Of course I haven't found anything to do yet,
but I mean to try."</p>

<p>"You expect to give your whole time to flying?"
asked the other. He had thought, naturally,
that a girl in Linda Carlton's circumstances
would just do it for sport.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a regular full-time job. I'm not sure
what&mdash;not selling planes, for I don't believe I'd
care for that. And not the mail&mdash;unless I can't
get anything else. You don't happen to know
of any openings, do you, Mr. Pitcairn?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said. "Things are a little
slow now. Of course there are the air-transportation
companies, but their routes are about
as cut-and-dried as the mail pilot's.... I take
it you would rather have a little more excitement....
There's crop dusting, during the
summer. You have heard of that, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have read about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know, then, that one plane flying over
a field can spray as many plants in a day as a
hundred of the ordinary spraying machines?"</p>

<p>His listeners gasped in astonishment. What
marvelous advances in progress aviation was
bringing about!</p>

<p>"I happen to know of a company in the South
that is just forming," he continued. "Because
of lack of capital, they are in great need of
pilots with planes of their own. If you are interested,
I am sure they would be glad to take
you on."</p>

<p>"That sounds very interesting," agreed
Linda, eagerly. "I'm sure I'd like that. And
an autogiro ought to be especially adapted for
this kind of thing. I could fly so low&mdash;and land
so easily&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly! Incidentally, you'd be doing our
company a big favor by showing the public new
uses for an autogiro. If Miss Carlton, of international
reputation, flies anywhere, the account
of it is sure to be in the newspapers!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't count too much on that, Mr. Pitcairn,"
protested Linda, modestly. "I really
am not 'news' any more.... But I shall be
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
grateful for the name of this firm, if you will
write it down for me. Where is it located?"</p>

<p>"In Georgia&mdash;the southern part," he informed
her. "Here is the address," he added,
handing her a card. "And I will write myself
today to tell them of their good fortune!"</p>

<p>"Georgia!" repeated Louise. "It's going to
be awfully hot there, Linda. Compared with
Green Falls&mdash;or even Spring City."</p>

<p>"Why not pick a job in Canada?" suggested
Ted. "You'd like Canada, if you didn't choose
the coldest part of the year to visit it."</p>

<p>Louise shuddered at the memory of their adventure
during the preceding Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>"I never want to see Canada again!" she
said. "And I don't believe Linda does either!"</p>

<p>It was not the memory of that cold night in
the Canadian woods, or of the cruelty of the
police, however, that made Linda frown and
hesitate now. Nor did the heat of the South
trouble her&mdash;weather was all in the day's work
to her. But the thought of the distance between
Georgia and Ohio, and what such a separation
might mean to her Aunt Emily, deterred her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
from accepting the offer immediately. It hardly
seemed right to be away all winter and spring,
and then to go far off again in the summer.</p>

<p>"Would I have to promise to do this all summer,
if I took it on?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not. A month would be enough,
for the first time. That would give you August
with your family, Miss Carlton, before you
accepted a regular aviation job in the fall."</p>

<p>This sounded much better to Linda, and she
promised to write within the nest week, if her
father agreed.</p>

<p>It was lots of fun riding back to Spring City
in her autogiro the following day, although she
flew alone, for Louise wanted to return with
Ted. Without a mishap of any kind she brought
the "Ladybug" down on the field behind her
house.</p>

<p>When she entered her home, she found that
her father had arrived during her absence. He
was waiting for her in the library.</p>

<p>"Daddy!" she cried, joyfully, for Mr. Carlton's
visits were always a pleasant surprise to
his only child. "You came at just the right
time! Come out and see my Bug!"</p>

<p>"Must you call it that, Linda?" asked her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Aunt Emily, who, like all good housekeepers
detested every sort of insect.</p>

<p>Linda laughed.</p>

<p>"Take a look at it, Aunt Emily, and see
whether you could think of a better name."</p>

<p>Miss Carlton peered through the screen door.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Come out on the porch, and you can see it,"
replied Linda.</p>

<p>Dragging her father and her aunt each by
a hand, she gleefully skipped through the door.</p>

<p>"There!" she cried, as one who displays a
marvel.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill, on the field behind the
lovely Colonial house, they saw the new possession.
Or rather, the top of the autogiro, for it
was not wholly visible.</p>

<p>"It looks like a clothes-dryer to me," remarked
Miss Carlton. "Or a wind-mill."</p>

<p>"But you agree that I couldn't call it my
'Clothes-dryer,' or my 'Wind-mill,' don't you,
Aunt Emily? The words are too long. Besides,
Lou thought of the cleverest name&mdash;the 'Ladybug.'
But you needn't worry, Auntie, she won't
ever creep into your spotless house!"</p>

<p>"I should hope not!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"In a way, Emily," observed Linda's father,
"it's a good name as far as you are concerned.
You hate planes&mdash;and you hate bugs!"</p>

<p>"Only, Aunt Emily is going to love my autogiro,"
insisted Linda, putting her arm affectionately
about the older woman, who had been
the only mother she had ever known. "One of
my biggest reasons for choosing an autogiro
was because it is the safest flying machine
known." Her tone grew soft, so low that her
father could not hear, and she added, with her
head turned aside, "I do want you to know that
I care about your feelings, Aunt Emily."</p>

<p>Miss Carlton's eyes grew misty; Linda had
always been so sweet, so thoughtful! Her niece
couldn't help it, if she had a marvelous brain,
and a mechanical mind. No wonder she wanted
to use them!</p>

<p>"It's going to be the ambition of my life to
convert Aunt Emily to flying," she announced,
in a gay tone. "See if I don't, Daddy!"</p>

<p>"I hope so," he said. "How about taking me
up for a little fly?"</p>

<p>"A fly?" repeated Linda, playfully. "You a
fly&mdash;and my new plane a bug! Oh, think of poor
Aunt Emily!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Linda, I do believe you're getting
silly!"</p>

<p>But already she was pulling her father down
the steps, eager to show off her beloved possession.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlton proved almost as enthusiastic as
his daughter about it. When they returned to
the house, he laughingly told his sister that he
was thinking of buying one for himself, to use
to fly back and forth from New York, where his
business was located.</p>

<p>Miss Carlton groaned.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have two flying maniacs in the
house!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Linda and I will usually be up in the
air," he corrected, "not often in the house."</p>

<p>Linda had scarcely time to change from her
flyer's suit into an afternoon dress, and no
chance at all to talk with her father about Mr.
Pitcairn's suggestion about a job, when Ralph
Clavering drove over to see her. Linda was delighted,
of course; here was another person to
whom she could display her autogiro. Ralph
was a licensed pilot, too, although with him
flying was only a secondary interest, and he
had never had his own plane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come out and see my 'Ladybug'!" she insisted.
"And wouldn't you like to try her out?
I might let you!"</p>

<p>"No, thanks, Linda&mdash;I'd be sure to do something
wrong. Besides, I'd rather talk to you&mdash;those
things make such an infernal noise. No,
just show it to me, and then let's go and have
a game of tennis before supper, if you're not
too tired."</p>

<p>"I've almost forgotten how to play," replied
the girl. "But I'll try. If you will come out and
see my 'Ladybug' first."</p>

<p>After they had examined the autogiro, and
were driving to the Country Club in Ralph's
roadster, the young man turned the conversation
to the topic of vacation at Green Falls, the
resort at which Linda's aunt, and most of her
friends, had spent the preceding summer.
Ralph told Linda about a new motor boat that
he was getting, and spoke of the contests in all
sorts of sports that would be repeated this year.</p>

<p>"How soon do you think you can get off,
Linda?" he concluded eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not till August, I'm afraid," she replied,
to his dismay.</p>

<p>"August!" he repeated, in horror. "You're
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
not going to pull some new stunt on us, are you,
Linda? Fly the Pacific&mdash;or the Arctic Ocean?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed, and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm through with stunts for a while, Ralph&mdash;you
needn't worry about that. No; what I am
planning now is steady work. I expect to take
a job, as soon as Kit's wedding is over."</p>

<p>"A job? Where?"</p>

<p>"In Georgia, probably." She went into details
about the proposition.</p>

<p>"You would!" he muttered, sulkily. "And
pick out such a hot spot, that nobody would
want to go with you.... Linda, why can't you
be sensible like other girls&mdash;like my sister Kit,
for instance?"</p>

<p>"Kit?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And get married."</p>

<p>He leaned over hopefully, and put his hand on
her arm. Now that Linda had accomplished her
ambition in flying the Atlantic, perhaps she
would be willing to settle down to marriage and
a normal life.</p>

<p>But she drew away, smiling.</p>

<p>"Don't, Ralph!" she warned him. "Remember
that you promised me you wouldn't ask me
till you had finished college."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, all right," he muttered, irritably,
resolving that he wouldn't again. Let her wait
awhile! She'd probably get tired of working
after she'd had a taste of it for a month in that
hot climate.</p>

<p>They met Dot Crowley and Jim Valier at the
tennis courts, and doubled up with them for a
couple of sets. But they were badly beaten, for
these two were the best team at the Club.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening Linda had a chance
to tell her father and her aunt of her proposed
plan for the coming month, and won their consent,
when she announced her intention of
spending August at Green Falls. To Miss Carlton
she put the all-important question of
clothes; the older woman promised to get her
half a dozen flyer's suits of linen for the trip.</p>

<p>During the next week Linda accepted enough
invitations to satisfy even her Aunt Emily, and
she wore one new dress after another, and flitted
from tennis match or picnic to tea or dance,
as the program happened to be. The grand
finale was Kitty's wedding, at the girl's beautiful
home just outside of Spring City.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous affair, and Linda could
not help thinking how Bess Hulbert, the Lieutenant's
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
sister, would have enjoyed it, had she
not given her life in the attempt to win the big
prize which Linda herself had captured. Personally,
she did not like the affair nearly so
much as Louise's simple wedding at Easter.</p>

<p>Linda was quiet as she drove home beside her
Aunt Emily in the limousine. She could not help
wondering whether this event did not mark the
end of her girlhood, the beginning of her career
as a self-supporting woman&mdash;out in the world.
No longer would she be free to come and go as
she liked, to see her old friends at any and all
hours of the day and evening. The thought was
a little saddening, and she sighed.</p>

<p>Her aunt laid her hand over her niece's.</p>

<p>"Why the sigh, dear?" she inquired.
"Tired?"</p>

<p>Linda nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and weddings are so solemn&mdash;so sort
of sad, aren't they, Auntie? To the other people,
I mean&mdash;for of course there's nothing sad
about Kit and Tom. But it means I won't see
them much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't their wedding that causes that,
dear," Miss Carlton reminded her. "Kitty and
Tom will be back and forth often, I think, for
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
they are not living far away.... But it's you
who are leaving the rest, Linda. Oh, if you only
wouldn't go so far away, dear!"</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Aunt Emily," admitted
the other. "But I can't have my cake and
eat it too. There isn't any flying job in Spring
City."</p>

<p>Miss Carlton was silent; there was no use in
going over the old argument. Instead, she
asked:</p>

<p>"How soon do you go, Linda?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow&mdash;if the weather is good. I received
my map and my instructions several days
ago. I'm all ready. The Ladybug's in perfect
shape."</p>

<p>"If you only didn't have to go alone!" sighed
the older woman.</p>

<p>"Yes. If I only had Lou!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you take some other girl?"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I did suggest such a
thing to Dot Crowley. She's competent, you
know&mdash;has her pilot's license&mdash;and she's such a
peach of a girl. I know we'd get along beautifully
together. But she's all tied up with a tennis
match, and can't possibly leave now."</p>

<p>Little did Linda think, as she took off the following
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
morning in the bright June sunshine,
how deeply she was to regret this decision of
Dot's, how she was to wish a hundred times
within the next week that she had some companion
who was a friend.</p>

<p class="pmb3">For the people she fell among proved to be
the worst sort of associates.</p>

<p class="pmb2" />


<p>As there was no particular hurry about the
trip South&mdash;it was only June twentieth&mdash;Linda
decided to go slowly and to stop often. What a
marvelous way to see the country, at the most
beautiful time of the year! In an autogiro the
flight would never become monotonous, for she
could fly low enough to watch the landscape.</p>

<p>Ohio&mdash;Kentucky&mdash;Tennessee&mdash;Georgia! Each
day she could travel through a different state,
putting up each night at a hotel. Fortunately
her Aunt Emily had given up worrying about
her staying alone in strange cities. For Linda
had already proved herself capable of taking
care of herself.</p>

<p>"It is because Linda is always so dignified,"
Mr. Carlton had remarked to his sister. "The
girls who make chance acquaintances, and permit
familiarities are usually looking for it.
Linda's mind is on her plane&mdash;on her navigation&mdash;and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
she is too absorbed to be bothered.
I think we are safe, Emily, in trusting her."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Miss Carlton had agreed.
"Though of course she'll always be a little girl
to me."</p>

<p>The day after the wedding was warm and the
skies were clear; the Ladybug was in perfect
condition, and her forty gallon tank was filled
with gasoline, so Linda decided to carry out
her plan. While her Aunt Emily packed her
lunch basket and a box with an emergency supply
of food, the girl called Miss Hawkins on the
telephone as she had promised.</p>

<p>"But don't put it into the paper until after
I start," begged Linda. "I always like to slip
off quietly, without any fuss."</p>

<p>"I'll save it for the evening editions," agreed
the reporter. "And then you'll be well on your
way.... And, thank you again, Miss Carlton."</p>

<p>An hour later she bade her aunt good-by, and
was off. Heading her plane south-west, she
would avoid the mountains in Kentucky, and
pass over the blue-grass region, of which she
had so often read. It was an ideal day for a
flight, and her heart beat with the same exultation
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
she had always felt when she was in the
air; there was no feeling to compare with it on
earth. Someone had said it was like being in
love&mdash;but Linda Carlton had never been in love
herself.</p>

<p>For several hours this sense of joy possessed
her; then, as noontime came, and she landed to
eat her lunch, she suddenly grew lonely. If only
Louise were with her! She sighed as she thought
that from now on she would probably be traveling
alone.</p>

<p>It grew hotter in the afternoon as she progressed
farther south, but her engine was functioning
so beautifully that she hated to stop.
Then the sun went down, and the coolness was
so delightful after the heat that she continued
on her course longer than she had planned, and
did not land until she had crossed the border
into Tennessee. There she followed a beacon
light that led to an airport, and brought the
Ladybug down to earth.</p>

<p>No sooner had she brought the autogiro to a
stop than a group of curious people surrounded
her.</p>

<p>"What do you-all call this?" drawled a big,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
good-natured looking man, with the typical
Southern accent. "It's a new one on me."</p>

<p>Linda smiled and explained, asking that the
autogiro be housed for the night, and inquired
her way to the hotel.</p>

<p>"The hotel ain't so good," replied the man.
"But I can direct you to a fine boarding-house."</p>

<p>Everybody that Linda met in this little town
was kindness itself. She found herself in a
pleasant home, with a marvelous supper of real
old-fashioned Southern cooking, all ready for
her. It appeared to be the custom to eat late
in the South; no one thought it strange that
she should want her supper at nine o'clock.</p>

<p>These good people's hospitality only served
to strengthen her confidence in the fact that she
was safe in traveling alone. For this reason
the shock was all the greater for her when that
trust was so rudely shaken later on during the
trip.</p>

<p>Linda liked the town so well that she decided
to remain a day, and go over her Ladybug herself.
For, she argued sensibly, if no one there
had ever heard of an autogiro before, it stood
to reason that there would be little chance of a
competent inspection by anyone but herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Miss Hawkins, the reporter, had
published the facts concerning her trip that
evening, the news had not reached this town in
Tennessee immediately. It was not until the
next day that the story was reprinted, and
someone discovered that this stranger in the
autogiro who was visiting them was Linda Carlton
of international fame. Then the news spread
like wild-fire about the town, and the band was
gotten out to give the girl a royal welcome.</p>

<p>It was hardly necessary, with all this celebration,
to wire her aunt of her safe arrival
in Tennessee; nevertheless Linda did so, as she
had promised when she left home.</p>

<p>Her next day's journey brought her across
Tennessee, over the mountains where she had a
chance to test her plane's climbing ability, and
into Georgia. Here again she was received with
hospitality. It seemed almost as if she were
making a "good-will" flight, so delighted were
the people to greet her and make her at home.</p>

<p>A long flight lay ahead of her&mdash;across
Georgia, the largest state in the southeast. Over
the mountains in the northern part, across cotton
and rice and sweet-potato plantations, towards
the coast. The weather was hot and dry;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
she grew tired and thirsty, and the thought of
her friends, enjoying the cool breezes at Green
Falls made her envious for a while. But she
carried plenty of water in her thermos flasks,
and she reminded herself that she was having
a more thrilling experience than they could
possibly have. Tonight she could rest&mdash;and
sleep.</p>

<p>Her head ached and her body was weary, as
she looked at her map and tried to find out just
where she was from the land-marks. Dismay
took hold of her as she realized that she must
have gone off of her course&mdash;beyond her destination.
The ground below appeared marshy,
in many spots entirely covered with water, in
which water-lilies and rushes grew in abundance.
Where could she possibly be?</p>

<p>Panic seized her as she realized that this was
no place to land. Even an autogiro couldn't
come down in a swamp. She circled around,
and went back. If the light only held out until
she reached some sort of level, hard ground!</p>

<p>She thought of her flight over the ocean, when
she had been so absolutely alone, and she felt
the same desolation, the same fierce terror.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Where was she? Where was she going? Wild-eyed,
she studied her map.</p>

<p>Then she located herself. This must be the
Okefenokee Swamp, in the southeastern part
of Georgia. That lonely, forsaken land, some
parts of which had never been penetrated by a
white man! Treacherous, dangerous ground,
which would mean certain death if she attempted
to land! Miles and miles of desolation,
that only an Indian could safely explore!</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but head the plane
towards the west, in hope of passing over the
swamp. The sun had set, and darkness was coming
on, but Linda could still see the ground beneath
her. The water grew scarcer, and trees&mdash;pine
and cypress&mdash;here and there dotted the
land. But still the earth looked marshy, too
treacherous for a landing.</p>

<p>A terrifying thought seized her when she remembered
that she had not filled her gasoline
tank that morning. Glancing at the indicator,
she saw that she had only three gallons left.
Would that be enough to take her out of this
"trembling land," which was the meaning of
the Indian word, "Okefenokee"?</p>

<p>It was like a horrible night-mare, watching
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the decreasing gasoline supply, the fading
light, and the trees and the swamp beneath her.
Her breath came in gasps; the idea of death
in a swamp was more horrible than that of
drowning in the middle of the Atlantic, for the
former would be a lingering torture.</p>

<p>But at last to her delight she saw the trees
widen, and a level stretch of dry sand below.
This must be an island, she concluded, for she
had read that there were half a dozen or so of
these in the swamp, and that they were several
miles in length. If this were true, she could
land, and be safe for the night at least.</p>

<p>She brought her autogiro lower, and with her
flash-light and her glasses examined the ground.
Yes, there was space enough for a landing, with
a plane like hers. She uttered a gasp of relief.</p>

<p>But she had rejoiced too soon, for when she
lifted her eyes from the ground to the level of
her plane she was startled breathless by the
sight of another plane, which had come out
of nowhere, apparently, and was rushing madly
at her. As if it were actually aiming to crash
into her! As if this were warfare, and the oncoming
plane an enemy, intent upon her destruction!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>In that instant she realized that this was an
old plane&mdash;possibly one of those abandoned by
the Army&mdash;one that would not now pass inspection.
No wonder it was tipping so strangely;
it must be out of the pilot's control.</p>

<p>Linda did the only thing possible, for she
was too low to turn. She dropped gracefully
to the ground, avoiding a tree by a few inches.
Thank goodness, it was solid beneath her!</p>

<p>The other plane was landing too, she observed,
landing with a speed that was ten
times that of the autogiro, in a space that was
far too small. The inevitable occurred; Linda
closed her eyes as she saw it about to crash. A
terrifying thud followed; then a scream of
fright&mdash;and Linda opened her eyes to see the
plane on its side, nosed into a bank of bushes.
Had it not been for that undergrowth, the wreck
would have been far worse than it was.</p>

<p>Linda had turned off her engine, and she
jumped out of the autogiro immediately and
rushed to the scene of the disaster. What a
smash it was! No one would ever fly that plane
again!</p>

<p>Two people were lying tangled up in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
wreckage, whether dead or alive Linda could
not immediately tell.</p>

<p>At her approach the man in the rear cock-pit
opened his eyes and began to move his hands
and legs.</p>

<p>"Got a good knife, Linda?" he yelled, to the
girl's profound astonishment.</p>

<p>"I'll get one," she replied, wondering how
he could possibly know her name. Or was he
delirious, and thought he was talking to some
other Linda?</p>

<p>Hurrying back to her own plane she took out
her thermos flasks and her tool-kit, and returned
to the spot of the wreck. It was too dark
now to see the men distinctly, until she turned
on her flash-light. As she came closer, she saw
that the man who had spoken was wriggling
himself free. His face was scratched, blood was
running down his hands, but he apparently was
not seriously hurt.</p>

<p>"Lucky this is an open plane," he muttered.
"Now give me a hand, me girl!"</p>

<p>Linda did not like his tone, but she could
not refuse to help a human being in distress.
Gradually he crawled out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now for Susie!" he announced, as he raised
himself unsteadily on his legs.</p>

<p>Linda gasped. Was the other occupant a
woman? A thrill of relief passed over her, for
she had been terrified at the idea of being alone
with such a hard-looking man in this desolate
spot.</p>

<p>"A girl?" she stammered, pressing close to
the plane.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Me wife. Her name's Susie."</p>

<p>Linda flashed the light under the wreckage
of the plane, and distinguished a young woman
in a flyer's suit. She was unconscious.</p>

<p>Without another word they both set silently
to work to disentangle her. At last they dragged
her out&mdash;still unconscious. But she evidently
was still alive, though the man remarked that
her arm must be broken&mdash;and maybe an ankle
or two. He seemed very matter-of-fact about it
all.</p>

<p>"What's in that flask?" he demanded abruptly,
of Linda.</p>

<p>"Water," she replied.</p>

<p>"Water!" he snarled angrily. "Water!"</p>

<p>He looked as if he meant to hit her, and Linda
recoiled in terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go hunt my flask in that wreck!" he commanded.</p>

<p>"Do it yourself!" returned Linda, with sudden
spirit. "How do I know that that plane
won't burst into flames any minute?"</p>

<p>She was surprised at her sudden display of
independence; she had always depended upon
Louise to stick up for their rights. But she had
risen to the occasion, now that she was alone.</p>

<p>The man started to swear, when suddenly
the girl on the ground opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Take care, Slats!" she begged, to Linda's
astonishment. "We'll need this girl and her
plane&mdash;for I can't fly now!"</p>

<p>The man called "Slats" subsided, and went
over to the wreckage. Linda bent over the injured
"Susie," and put the flask of water to her
lips.</p>

<p>Like the man's, the girl's face was scratched
and bleeding, and she began to moan of the
pain in her wrist. Her helmet had been pushed
off, and her blond hair hung about her face.
Her lips were painted a brighter red than even
blood could have colored them.</p>

<p>"Where are you hurt?" asked Linda, wiping
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the girl's face with her handkerchief, and pushing
the hair out of her eyes.</p>

<p>"My wrist, worst. And this ankle. And my
back."</p>

<p>"If I have enough gasoline, we'll take you
to a hospital in my plane."</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried the girl, in terror.</p>

<p>"Why not?" questioned Linda.</p>

<p>"You'll find out," replied the other, mysteriously,
closing her eyes in pain.</p>

<p>Linda had no way of guessing what she
meant, so she sat waiting in silence until the
man returned. Five minutes later he appeared
with a tank of gasoline, and a flask of brandy,
which he gave to his wife to drink.</p>

<p>"We're ready to go now, Linda," he announced.
"You can help me carry Susie over
to your Bug."</p>

<p>Again Linda started violently at the mention
of her own name.</p>

<p>"Do you really know me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Sure we do! You're Linda Carlton. Think
you're about the smartest thing there is in the
air today. Bought one of them new-fangled
bugs. Ain't that right?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Partly," admitted Linda, wincing at the
slur in his remark. "But how could you possibly
know?"</p>

<p>"Because we are out to get you. Wasn't your
story in all the newspapers, tellin' all about this
trip of your'n? And ain't your Bug the easiest
thing to spot in the air?"</p>

<p>"Out to get me!" repeated Linda. "Do you
mean that you wanted to kill me?"</p>

<p>"No, lady. You're more use to us alive than
dead&mdash;for a while, anyway. No. Our gang decided
we could pick up a hundred grand easier
by kidnapping you than by swiping jewelry.
It was my idea!" He swelled with pride, believing
himself exceedingly clever. "And that's
what you get for wanting to have your picture
and glories in the papers all the time!"</p>

<p>Linda listened wild-eyed to this information,
and edged closer to Susie, as if her only protection
would be found in the girl.</p>

<p>"So now these is your orders: You fly us to
our camp tonight, and we'll keep you there.
You can sleep with Susie. We won't hurt you,
if you do what we tell you, and don't get fresh,
or try to get away. Once you do that, we shoot.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
And believe me, I can aim&mdash;O.K. I've had a
sight of practice in my business! I'm a mighty
successful man&mdash;in my line."</p>

<p>"And what is your line, outside of kidnapping?"
asked Linda.</p>

<p>"High-class robbery. Banks. Big jewels. We
don't never hold up nobody on the street, for
a few dollars. Too petty for us! Nope! We're
big men. Slick! Clever! Ask Susie!"</p>

<p>"Does Susie like all this?"</p>

<p>"Sure she does. We winter in Europe, and
South America, and she struts around with all
the big dames, flashing diamonds and duds that
make 'em all look pale.... Now come along!"</p>

<p>It was useless to argue or talk any more, so
Linda did as she was told, and together they got
Susie into the passenger's cock-pit of the autogiro.
Her husband sat with her, holding his
pistol up threateningly at the back of Linda's
head.</p>

<p>"Go where I tell you!" he ordered.</p>

<p>"I haven't much gas," she protested.</p>

<p>"I've got an extra flask here. But I'm not
pouring it in till we need it, which I don't think
we will. The camp ain't far&mdash;on Black Jack
Island."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Black Jack Island," Linda repeated to herself.
"What an appropriate name!"</p>

<p>She was terrified, of course, but there was
nothing to do except follow directions, and in a
few minutes she brought the plane down on
the island that the man had specified.</p>

<p>"Leave the Bug here, Linda," he commanded,
as he lifted Susie out of the plane. "And go
ahead of me, as I tell you."</p>

<p>For several minutes the little procession
made their way to the center of the island, over
the white sand towards the cypress and pine
trees that grew in greater profusion. Linda did
not look back, but she knew that while "Slats"
carried Susie with one arm, he kept his pistol
at her back with his other hand.</p>

<p>At last, by the aid of her flash-light, Linda
spied several tents set up near together, and a
welcome smell of food cooking greeted her as
she advanced.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Stop here!" came the order. "This is where
you spend the night!"</p>


<p class="break" />
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>


<h2><a id="Chapter_IV"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span></a><br /><br />

<i>Captive</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Linda and her companions stopped in front
of a large tent that was dimly lighted within
by a lantern. Two men were standing inside&mdash;one
bending over an oil cook-stove, the other at
the door.</p>

<p>"We got Linda!" announced "Slats" triumphantly.
"Without even smashing her
plane!"</p>

<p>He pushed through the doorway, past the
other man, and deposited Susie on a cot by the
wall of the tent.</p>

<p>The man at the stove, a big, fat, repulsive
looking brute, turned around and uttered an
ugly, "Hah!"</p>

<p>"Susie hurt?" inquired the tall, thin man
who had been standing at the edge of the tent.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Crashed her plane. I've got some
scratches meself, but I ain't whinin'!"</p>

<p>"My ankle's broken!" sobbed Susie, unable
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to suffer any longer in silence. "Hurry up and
get some bandages, Doc!"</p>

<p>Linda, who had been standing perfectly still
during this conversation, was startled by the
use of the name "Doc." Was it possible that
this man was a physician? If so, wouldn't he
perhaps be above the level of the others&mdash;and
might she not expect, if not sympathy, at least
fair play from him? But "Slats" instantly
shattered her hopes with his explanation.</p>

<p>"This is the 'Doc,' Linda," he said. "We
call him that because he fixes up all our aches
and cuts for us. In a profession like our'n, it
ain't safe to meddle with 'saw-bones' and hospitals.
They keep records."</p>

<p>Linda smiled at the idea of calling robbery a
"profession," but she made no comment.</p>

<p>"So long as you'll be with us fer a while,"
continued her captor, "I'll interduce you to
everybody. That there cook is 'Beefy.' Ain't he
a good ad for his own cookin'?"</p>

<p>Linda nodded; she could hardly be expected
to laugh at such a poor joke under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"You can go over and wash&mdash;there's water in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Susie's tent&mdash;if you want to, while the 'Doc'
fixes Susie up. Then we'll eat."</p>

<p>Glad to be alone for a moment, Linda stepped
across to the tent which the man had indicated,
hidden behind some pine trees a few yards
away. Guiding herself by her flash-light, she
found the entrance, and dropped down on a
cot inside.</p>

<p>Letting the light go off, she sat, dry-eyed and
utterly hopeless, staring into the darkness.
What terrible fate was hanging over her, she
dared not imagine. Would they torture her, perhaps,
if her father refused to raise the ransom,
and called the police to his aid?</p>

<p>In these last few hours she had learned to
realize how infinitely crueler human-beings
were than the elements of nature. The ice and
snow, the cold winds of Canada, or the vast,
trackless depths of the Atlantic could never
bring about such untold agony as these fiends
in human form. She almost wished that she had
gone down, like Bess Hulbert, in the ocean, before
she had lived to learn how evil men could
be.</p>

<p>A call from the mess-tent, as she supposed
the larger one to be, aroused her from her unhappy
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
meditations, and she hastily turned on
the light and washed from a pitcher of water
on a soap-box in Susie's tent.</p>

<p>When she returned to the group, she found
them already seated about a board table,
plunging into the food like hungry animals.
Susie, who sat with her bandaged ankle propped
up on a box, was the only one who ate with any
manners at all. But it had been a long time
since Linda had tasted food, and she was too
hungry to be deterred by the sight of "Beefy"
putting his fingers into his plate. So she sat
down next to Susie, and silently started to eat.</p>

<p>She found the meal exceedingly good, and was
surprised at her own appetite, for she hardly
expected to be able to enjoy anything under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>The lantern threw a weird, ghastly light over
the strange, ugly faces about her, and the
silence was unbroken, except by the noise and
clatter of eating. A tenseness took possession
of her; she wished desperately that somebody
would say something. It was exactly like a horrible
dream, whose spell could not be destroyed.
And still no one uttered a word until the meal
was concluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"You girls can go to bed now," Slats announced,
finally. "I'll carry you over, Susie, and
give you a gun, in case Linda tries to sneak off
in the night." He smiled with vicious triumph.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that wouldn't do me any good,"
replied Linda, trying to make her voice sound
normal. "I haven't an idea where I am."</p>

<p>"On Black Jack Island, in the Okefenokee
Swamp," he again told her. "With water all
around you. Get that! You can't get away,
without a boat or a plane. And I'm tellin' you
now, I seen to it that your Bug's bone-dry!"</p>

<p>With a conceited grin, he leaned over and
picked up his wife so roughly that she cried
out in pain.</p>

<p>When they were alone, the girls took off some
of their outer garments, and lay down on their
cots. Linda longed to talk, but she was afraid
to begin, for fear it would only lead to some
sort of punishment. So she lay still, trying to
forget her troubles, to believe everything would
come out right in the end, when her father paid
the ransom.</p>

<p>She was just dozing off, when she was abruptly
aroused by agonized sobs from her tent-mate.
She sat up and asked her companion
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
whether there was anything she could get her.
But Susie did not answer; she continued to
cry wildly like a child of six.</p>

<p>"Oh, my ankle! My ankle!" she moaned. And
then she used worse language than any Linda
had ever heard&mdash;from man or woman.</p>

<p>Linda was sorry for her, but she could not
help contrasting this girl's cowardice in the
face of physical pain with Dot Crowley's, when
the latter had met with a similar accident, and
had smiled bravely at the hurt. She thought,
too, of Ted Mackay's courage in the hospital,
and Susie suffered by the comparisons.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do?" she asked,
again.</p>

<p>"No. Only take me to a <i>real</i> doctor&mdash;or a
hospital."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to, if your husband would let me
fly my plane!"</p>

<p>"Well, he won't!" There followed more
oaths. "What does he care&mdash;so long as he ain't
the one that's hurt?" She continued to cry
hysterically, until a snarling order came from
without the tent.</p>

<p>"Shut up your noise!" bawled her husband,
and Susie softened her sobbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Linda lay very still, thinking. Dared she suggest
that the other girl deceive her husband&mdash;or
would she only be punished for such an idea?
She decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>"You must know where the men keep the
gasoline," she whispered. "Wouldn't you
rather have your ankle fixed right, and not run
the chance of being a cripple for life?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Susie, raising
her head from her pillow.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;wait till the men are asleep, and
then you tell me where the gas is, and we'll
sneak off. I'd take you to a hospital, and I'd
promise never to tell on you."</p>

<p>"And lose all that ransom money? Slats'd
never forgive me!"</p>

<p>"But what good's money, if you're a cripple?"
countered Linda.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;I see what you mean," agreed Susie.
"Only we'd never get away with it. They'd
hear us gettin' out&mdash;remember I can't walk by
myself.... No, Linda&mdash;it's no go."</p>

<p>Disappointed, Linda dropped back on the cot,
seeing that further argument was no use, and,
fortunately, fell quickly asleep. Had she not
been so tired, she would probably have been
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
disturbed during the night, for Susie tossed and
moaned without any regard for her companion.
But Linda slept the sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Just as dawn was beginning to show a faint
light through the door of the tent, Linda was
rudely awakened by a gruff voice. Startled, she
looked into the unpleasant face of Susie's husband,
and she shuddered as she recalled where
she was. The thought flashed into her mind that
soldiers and criminals were usually shot at
sunrise, and her hands shook with fear. What
was the man going to do to her?</p>

<p>"Get up, Linda!" he commanded. "You're
working today."</p>

<p>"Working?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Flying."</p>

<p>"Where?" she demanded, with a trace of
hope. If she were allowed to fly, there might be
some hope of escape.</p>

<p>"Across the swamp. To an island out in the
ocean."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>An island! It sounded like imprisonment. She
thought of Napoleon on St. Helena, and she
remembered the stories of the cruelties to the
French convicts, sentenced to die on an island.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Terrible climate, probably, reeking with disease.
A slow death that would be far greater
torture than being shot&mdash;hours of lingering
agony, when she would think of her father and
her aunt, and of the suffering that she was
causing them! And, worst of all, no one to
rescue her, as Ted had twice saved her from
disasters that were not half so dreadful!</p>

<p>But she did not cry; she was disgusted with
tears after the way that Susie had carried on
the night before, over her sprained ankle. After
all, it was no one else's fault that she had selected
this job; she had taken it on, and she
must see it through, no matter what the outcome.</p>

<p>When she had washed and dressed, she
walked over to the big tent, where she found
breakfast ready. Bacon and eggs and coffee&mdash;and
even oranges! Evidently they meant to
feed her well&mdash;for this much she could be
thankful.</p>

<p>She ate in silence with the three men, for
Slats did not carry Susie to the table. When they
had finished, and the men were lighting their
pipes, Slats pushed back his tin plate and began
to talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our idea in running you down was to get a
neat little ransom, Linda," he repeated, with the
same triumphant grin which she had grown to
loathe. She winced, too, at each repetition of
her first name, though there was no way that
she could stop him from using it.</p>

<p>"We figgered your old man could come across
with a couple hundred thousand to get you back.
When we get ready, we'll let him know. But in
the meantime, we ain't ready."</p>

<p>He winked knowingly at Beefy, and a cold
shiver of fear crept over Linda. If they would
only get the thing over quickly! Anything would
be better than the awful suspense.</p>

<p>The speaker laughed at her expression of
terror.</p>

<p>"Don't be scared, Linda. We ain't a goin' a
hurt you.... It just happens we need you for
a couple days in our business."</p>

<p>"Your business?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Yeah. We got some jewelry right here in
this tent worth about a hundred grand. We fly
across to an island with it, where a steamer
picks it up and gets it to our agent in South
America."</p>

<p>"But what has that to do with me?" asked
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Linda. Did they mean to leave her on the island,
or send her to South America?</p>

<p>"Just this: we're usin' your Bug and you as
pilot fer the job. Susie's the only one of our
gang can fly, and now she and the Jenny are
busted, we'll use you. Get me?"</p>

<p>Linda nodded, sadly. So she was to be made
to play a criminal part in their ugly game!
How she wished they would be caught!</p>

<p>"And you needn't scheme to get away," Slats
added. "Because I'll be right behind you, with
me gun loaded!"</p>

<p>Linda made no reply; after all there was
nothing to be said. She must take his orders,
or be instantly killed.</p>

<p>"Ready now?" he inquired, satisfied with
her silence. "We always work early in the day.
Maybe you better come over with me and take
a look at your plane, and I'll give you some
gas. See if she's O.K."</p>

<p>Dutifully Linda accompanied the man to the
edge of the island, and there was the autogiro,
safe and sound as ever&mdash;her only friend in the
world, it seemed!</p>

<p>She looked about her at the marshy water,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the trees and vegetation of the swamp, and
then up into the sky, which she searched vainly
for an airplane. But except for the birds, there
was no sign of life in that desolate, vast expanse
of land and sky. Not a human habitation in
sight!</p>

<p>Desperately, she wished that she could think
of some plan to outwit this lawless gang, but
everything seemed hopeless, as long as Slats
carried that pistol aimed at her head. So she
meekly inspected the autogiro and climbed into
the cock-pit.</p>

<p>Her companion was in a good humor; he was
enjoying the whole situation immensely, pleased
at his own cleverness. He liked to fly, and he
admired the autogiro; he even went so far as
to say he believed he'd keep this one for Susie.</p>

<p>Linda said nothing, but she was thinking
what a mistake that would be for him to make.
Much as she would hate to lose her autogiro,
she realized that its possession would give the
gang away to the police. It was one thing to
steal jewelry and money, and another to take
a plane, of a make of which there were only
perhaps a hundred in existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>They flew over the trees, eastward to the
prairie land, and then on through the coastal
plain to the Atlantic Ocean. Whether they were
crossing Florida or Georgia, Linda did not
know, and for once she was not interested in
the country. The sun rose as they came to the
water, but that beautiful sight, too, made no
impression upon the unhappy girl. Nothing but
the sight of a plane or a boat&mdash;the promise of
rescue&mdash;could have any meaning for her.</p>

<p>On and on she went, leaving the land behind
them, until finally they sighted an island possibly
five miles out. The man behind her shouted
to her to land, and she circled about, finally
coming down on the beach.</p>

<p>As she brought her autogiro to earth, she was
once more impressed by the loneliness, the barrenness
of it all. No habitation of any kind, not
even a tent! Motionless she sat in the cock-pit,
wondering whether she couldn't get away while
this thief was unloading his treasure.</p>

<p>Slats, however, was too wise for any such
trick; he commanded Linda to get out of the
plane, and help him carry a heavy box across
the island where a growth of bushes concealed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a hole in the ground, which was evidently the
pre-arranged hiding-place. In silence they
buried the treasure and returned to the autogiro.</p>

<p>Retracing their course under his direction,
Linda flew back to the encampment. Here they
found the others finishing their lunch, and
Susie was sitting with them, apparently much
brighter and better, for she was laughing and
talking to her companions.</p>

<p>As Linda and her captor finished their meal,
a stranger put in his stealthy appearance at
the door of the tent. He was well-dressed, in
riding-breeches, and clean-shaven. Linda's heart
gave a wild bound of hope. Was it possible
that this man was an officer of the law, and
the criminals were caught?</p>

<p>But Beefy's greeting to the visitor instantly
dispelled her hopes.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jake!" he exclaimed. "What's
new?"</p>

<p>"Everything ripe for tonight," announced
the new-comer, briefly. "Ready to start now?"</p>

<p>Slats stood up. "O.K. with me," he said.
"Want some grub first, Jake?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;I just ate." The stranger turned smilingly
to Linda. "And how's the most famous
girl-pilot in the world?"</p>

<p>Linda recoiled in horror. So he too knew all
about the plot to catch her! Another member
of this terrible gang!</p>

<p>As she did not answer, he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Got the lines out about her yet?" he inquired,
of the other men.</p>

<p>"No," replied Slats. "We had a smash-up&mdash;wrecked
Susie and the Jenny, so we'll need
Linda to fly her plane for us till this job's over
tonight. I'll give you the high sign when I'm
ready to let her old man know."</p>

<p>The four men stood together at the door of
the tent.</p>

<p>"We're leaving for a day&mdash;maybe two," Slats
informed Linda. "But Susie's watching you,
with a gun. And your plane's dry, so I wouldn't
advise to try any get-away. There's swamps
everywhere....</p>

<p>"So long...."</p>

<p class="pmb3">A moment later the girls heard the men tramp
away to the boat that the new-comer had
brought to the edge of the island.</p>


<p class="break" />

<h2><a id="Chapter_V"><span class="smcap">Chapter V</span></a><br /><br />

<i>Escape</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>It was with a sigh of relief that Linda
watched her captors disappear. Not that she
had any hope of getting free&mdash;without gasoline&mdash;but
at least she would not see those dreadful
men for a few hours. Susie was not nearly so
bad.</p>

<p>"I hope you can cook," remarked the latter,
surveying her bandaged ankle.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Linda. "I've often camped
out before."</p>

<p>"Then we can enjoy ourselves for a while.
I'm glad to get rid of that gang.... And,
Linda&mdash;how 'bout if we be friends? No use making
things worse by getting mad at <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"True," admitted Linda, though she wondered
what she could possibly find in common
with the other girl that might inspire friendship.</p>

<p>Seeing a kettle of water steaming on the oilstove,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
she set herself to the task of washing the
dishes.</p>

<p>"Wish I could help," remarked Susie, in a
friendly tone. "But after this there won't be so
many dishes&mdash;for just the two of us."</p>

<p>"When do you expect them back?" inquired
her prisoner.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning, probably. If they get
their loot."</p>

<p>"Suppose they get caught?" suggested
Linda.</p>

<p>"They won't. Don't worry! They've been
planning this crack for months, and you can bet
everything's all set just right. They never get
caught."</p>

<p>Linda sighed. It wasn't very promising.</p>

<p>"Tell me how you got into a gang like this?"
she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"I fell for Slats," replied the other girl.
"Thought he was a rich guy&mdash;he spent so much
money on me. I was working as a clerk at an
airport, and learning to fly. We ran off and got
married."</p>

<p>"But when you discovered that he wasn't
straight, why didn't you leave him?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't. He said he'd hunt me down, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
'bump me off,' if I did. And he meant it, too.
Slats isn't afraid of anything.... I saw right
away that he didn't want a wife, but a pilot,
who'd do what he said.... The only fun I get
out of it is in the winter, when we go to Europe
or South America, and live like swells. Then
he lets me spend all the money I want."</p>

<p>"But doesn't it make you feel dreadful&mdash;at
night, sometimes, or when you're alone&mdash;to
think of leading such a wicked life?"</p>

<p>"Now, Linda, be yourself!" answered Susie,
flippantly. "No preaching! From you, or anybody
else!"</p>

<p>Linda turned away and completed her task
in silence. What was the use of talking to a
person like that? She knew now what was meant
by the term "hard-boiled." If ever a word described
anyone, that word described Susie.</p>

<p>She wondered, as she worked, whether it
would be worth-while to repeat her suggestion
of the night before. Susie's ankle was so much
better today that she would not be so eager
to get to a real doctor. Still, there could be no
harm in trying.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go off in my autogiro
today?" she inquired, without turning around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Her companion laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Not a chance!" she replied. "Didn't you see
Beefy take that big can to the boat with him?
That was <i>gas</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Linda, her hopes dashed
to the ground. "You mean they don't trust
you?"</p>

<p>"They don't trust anybody!" announced the
other girl, emphatically. "It don't pay&mdash;in a
game like theirs."</p>

<p>"Would you have gone with me?" inquired
Linda. "If they hadn't taken it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. My ankle's better. But I'm
sick and tired of Slats, though I guess I'd miss
the cash and the excitement. And I guess I'd
be too scared he'd get me in the end if I double-crossed
him."</p>

<p>Linda was silent. Now that this hope was
frustrated, she must think of something else.
Surely this was her chance of escape&mdash;with the
men away, and her only companion a cripple.</p>

<p>But the swamp&mdash;the dreadful swamp was all
about her. How far into the depth of the Okefenokee
she was, she did not know. It was all a
vast unexplored wilderness to her.</p>

<p>"Alive with snakes and wild animals, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
alligators, I suppose," she mused. Yet nothing
savage could be worse than those three fiends
in human flesh who were holding her captive.
She determined to face anything rather than
them. Yes; she would run away, if it meant
swimming the swamp!</p>

<p>There was no use loading herself down with
food, she concluded, for most of her trip would
be through the water. She would stop at her
plane and take out some chocolate, and her
knife; thus lightly equipped, she would face
the wilderness alone.</p>

<p>"Linda," said Susie, interrupting these
thoughts, "will you go to my tent and get me a
magazine I have there? I think it's under the
cot."</p>

<p>Linda nodded, repressing a smile. She would
go, but she would not come back!</p>

<p>Stepping into the smaller tent, she dropped
the flap, and picked up her flash-light. Then,
raising the wall on the other side, she crept
out through the trees to the edge of the island
and circled about until she reached the autogiro.
This would give her a few minutes extra before
Susie should realize that she had gone.</p>

<p>As she stood there beside her plane for a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
moment, wondering whether she would ever see
it again, she had her first real sight of the
Okefenokee Swamp from the ground. Cypress
and slash pine trees grew in abundance, and
heavy moss hung about. In the water all around
her, she noticed rushes and water-lilies, and
ferns grew everywhere in profusion. Beneath
the surface, she could see thick vegetation;
would this, she wondered, support her weight if
she were to attempt to walk in it?</p>

<p>In the afternoon sunlight the water, the trees,
were perfectly still; except for the birds, the
silence was profound. How desolate it was! Her
wrist-watch informed her that it was already
four o'clock. Five hours more, and darkness
would come on, enveloping everything in a
blackness such as a city-dweller never sees.
Even the sky might be hidden by the trees, and
the wild animals would be prowling stealthily
about in search of food. She shuddered and
hesitated.</p>

<p>"But I have an even chance with the animals,"
she thought. "And with those thieves,
I am sure to lose!" So valiantly, she stepped out
into the water.</p>

<p>The depth was not great at this point, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
she discovered that, though the soft muck sunk
beneath her feet, she could still make progress.
The hard rains of July and August had not yet
set in, and the "bays," as the stretches of shallow
water were called, had not risen to any
great height.</p>

<p>Laboriously she waded onward, choosing a
thick growth of trees in the distance as her goal.
Surely, she thought, where the trees could grow
there must be some dry land. If she could make
that spot by nightfall, she could hide in their
depths and sleep. Then tomorrow she could
press on to the westward, and perhaps reach
the end of the swamp.</p>

<p>It was a slow, weary progress that she accomplished,
and she had to pick her way carefully,
measuring the depth of the water with
a stick which she had cut from a pine on Black
Jack Island, but she kept resolutely on until
her watch registered seven o'clock. Then, all of
a sudden, the stick sunk so deeply into the muck
that she knew she would have to swim, and she
hastily ate the chocolate which was to be her
evening meal, and plunged forward to swim.</p>

<p>As the time slowly passed, she watched Black
Jack Island fading in the distance, and hope
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
swelled in her heart. She was nearing land at
last&mdash;perhaps only an island&mdash;but even if she
were not out of the swamp, at least she would
be away from her enemies. She smiled when
she pictured the consternation and anger of the
men at finding her gone.</p>

<p>She swam on for some distance, now and
then pausing to cut the grasses that became
entangled about her legs. Her shoes were heavy,
but she hated to take them off, for they were
a help in the shallow water.</p>

<p>After an hour of this exercise, she was utterly
exhausted, and she looked about her in dismay.
What if she should drown now, in the midst of
her own country&mdash;after she had conquered the
Atlantic Ocean successfully? The thought was
absurd; she steeled herself to press forward,
for she was coming nearer to that bank of trees.
Surely, there lay safety!</p>

<p>Had she but known it, she was now entering
one of the so-called "Gator Roads" of the
swamp&mdash;channels of water which the alligators
followed. But it looked promising to the tired,
hungry girl.</p>

<p>The foliage was growing thicker now, and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
water-way narrowing. Some distance on, the
trees met overhead, and beautiful moss hung
from their branches, shutting out the setting
sunlight, and forming a lovely green bower.
But Linda was scarcely conscious of this beauty,
for she was breathing with difficulty, panting
with fatigue. If she could only make that bank&mdash;where
the land seemed firm!</p>

<p>A big tree had fallen across the water, and
she managed to reach it, and to cling to it for
support while she rested. Her feet hung down
in the muck, and she realized that the water
was comparatively shallow. She wanted to laugh
aloud in her relief.</p>

<p>Pulling herself up by her hands, she decided
to walk the log to the bank, and had just poised
herself upon its rather perilous round surface,
when she encountered the greatest shock in her
life thus far. Not ten yards away, in the very
water where she would have been now, had she
not mounted the log&mdash;was an alligator, at least
eight feet long! Brave as she was usually in
the face of other dangers, she let out a piercing
scream of terror at the sight of this horrible
monster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I've got to walk the log!" she thought.
"It's death if I fall off!"</p>

<p>She watched the alligator a minute or two
while she regained her self-control, and made
sure that he was not moving. Then, with eyes
straight ahead, she started to walk the log.</p>

<p>Once, toward the middle, she swayed, but it
was only for a second. She straightened herself
staunchly and marched on&mdash;to dry land.</p>

<p>Oh, the joy of feeling her feet on firm ground
again! To know that whatever misfortune
might come on the morrow, she was safe for
that night at least! She could not drown, or be
tortured by enemies; her only danger would
come from snakes. She would take the precaution
to explore her sleeping-place thoroughly
before she lay down.</p>

<p>Weary as she was, she did not stop until she
had gone farther into the island. The trees were
denser here than they had been at Black Jack;
it would be more difficult to land an autogiro, if
by chance Susie should follow her. Nevertheless,
she resolved to stay hidden as much as possible.</p>

<p>Away from the shore, she finally dropped to
the ground and took off her wet shoes and
stockings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not that it will do me much good in the
morning to start off dry," she thought bitterly.
"But anyhow, I don't want to sleep in
them." And then she removed her outer garments.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't supper taste good!" she said
aloud, envying Susie that well-filled larder at
the camp. But Linda knew that there was no
danger of her starving so soon, after that big
noon-day meal, and she put the thought of food
from her mind. Water she could not forget so
easily. After half an hour's thirst, she decided
to risk a drink from the swamp. Had she but
known that the water of the Okefenokee is not
poisonous, she would have enjoyed her drink
more. The "peat" gives it a queer taste, but it
is harmless.</p>

<p>She was relieved, in her return to the water,
to see that the alligator had gone&mdash;which way,
she could not tell. Though she was desolately
lonely in that vast abandoned wilderness, she
did not care for the companionship of so ugly
a beast!</p>

<p>When she returned to the spot which she had
selected for her camp, she took her knife from
its wet case and cut a few stout sticks from a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
tree. With these she would explore the ground
before she lay down, and keep them at her side
while she slept, as some sort of protection from
snakes.</p>

<p>As with the water, however, Linda's fears
regarding snakes proved unnecessary, for the
report of a large number of these in the Okefenokee
Swamp had been proved by hunters to
have been exaggerated. As a matter of fact,
Linda did not see one during her entire visit
to the swamp.</p>

<p>She waited until the daylight had faded, and
darkness completely enveloped the landscape
before she lay down to rest. The stars were still
visible here and there through the trees, and,
as upon the occasion of her lonely flight to
Paris, they somehow seemed friendly. After
an hour or so, she slipped off to sleep.</p>

<p>Only once during that strange, desolate night
did she awaken, and that was when something
cold and wet suddenly touched her face. She
started up fearfully, seizing a stick with one
hand and her knife with the other, squinting
her eyes for snakes. Her flash-light had of
course been thrown away during her swim, so
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
she could not immediately identify the enemy
that had awakened her.</p>

<p>She laughed out loud when she finally saw
what it was. She had rolled over against her
shoes, which were still cold and clammy with
water!</p>

<p>She went back to sleep again, and did not
awaken until the sun was well up in the sky.
She had no way of telling the exact time, for
her watch refused to go after its bath in the
swamp, but Linda judged from the sun that it
must be nine o'clock at least. Her clothing was
dry, at any rate, and her shoes only a little
damp. But what a sight she was, she thought,
after that long swim!</p>

<p>She went down to the water's edge to wash,
and to drink the water that must serve as her
breakfast, and looked carefully about her&mdash;into
the sky, and on the water&mdash;for the sight
of her enemies. For she had no doubt that as
soon as the thieves returned, they would go in
search of her, believing that she could not have
gotten far away.</p>

<p>She was relieved to see nothing, no sign of
human beings anywhere, and she paused to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
watch some wild birds fly past overhead. Everything
was peaceful and quiet&mdash;like a Sunday
morning in the country. It was hard to believe
that wickedness existed in such a beautiful
world.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, she noticed the soft swish of
water not far away from her, and she looked
up quickly, expecting to see the alligator again.
In that awful second, her worst fears were
realized. A canoe, with two men aboard, was
coming straight towards her. The thieves! They
had sighted her&mdash;they were wildly waving their
arms.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It was too late to hide!</p>

<i>The Enemy in the Autogiro</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Defeated, miserable, hopeless, Linda sank to
the ground and buried her face in her hands,
waiting for the dreaded approach of her enemies.
Oh, the cruelty of fate, to deliver her to
them again, after her superhuman effort to
escape! Bitter tears rushed to her eyes, scalding
her face, and she sat as one expecting death,
listening to the rhythmic dip of the paddles, as
the canoe came closer and closer.</p>

<p>She kept her face hidden until the sound
ceased, informing her thereby that the craft had
stopped at her side. Tensely she waited for the
harsh snarl of her captor's voice. But to her
incredulous amazement, she heard instead the
soft, deep, well-bred tones of a Southerner!</p>

<p>"Can we be of any help to you, Miss?" inquired
the speaker.</p>

<p>Linda looked up instantly into the kind eyes
of two exceedingly attractive young men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Please!" she gasped, the tears still
running from her eyes. "Yes, please!"</p>

<p>And then, for the first time in her life, Linda
Carlton fainted.</p>

<p>When she came to, she was lying on the
ground, with two strangers bending over her,
one offering her water, and the other hot coffee
from a thermos bottle. A warm glow of happiness
surged over her as she realized that she
was among real human beings&mdash;not animals, or
criminals. Though not naturally impulsive, she
longed to throw her arms about these boys and
weep with gratitude. If they had been girls,
she would not have hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>Instead, she sat up and smiled her sweetest
smile, so that, bedraggled as she was, she was
still beautiful. The boys, man-like, each urged
his particular offering upon her.</p>

<p>"Put that coffee down, Hal!" commanded the
tall, fair youth at her right. "A lady who has
just fainted doesn't want coffee."</p>

<p>"I do, though," Linda assured him. "I want
water, and coffee&mdash;and anything else you have
to eat. I fainted from hunger as much as from
anything else."</p>

<p>The boy called "Hal" looked pleased at her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
acceptance of his gift, and he hurried back to
the canoe for some food.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" asked the other, who remained
at Linda's side. "And how do you happen
to be here?"</p>

<p>"It's a long story," replied the girl, wondering
just how much of it she had better tell. It
was all so incredulous, that perhaps they
wouldn't believe her if she did tell them.</p>

<p>"First have some food," suggested the boy
who had gone to the canoe. "How long has it
been since you ate?"</p>

<p>"Only yesterday noon&mdash;and I even had some
chocolate about six o'clock. But after that I
waded and swam from Black Jack Island to this
place&mdash;whatever it is."</p>

<p>"This is 'Billy's Island,'" the boys informed
her. "Named after 'Billy Bowlegs,' the Indian
who once lived here.... But, Great Guns!"
exclaimed Hal, "that's five miles at least! Nobody
ever tried to swim the Okefenokee Swamp
before!"</p>

<p>"Well, it seemed like twenty-five," remarked
Linda. "And I hope nobody ever has to try it
again."</p>

<p>She did not go on with her story immediately,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
for she was too busy eating bananas&mdash;one right
after another. Nothing had ever tasted so good!
Meanwhile, the boys introduced themselves as
Hal&mdash;short for Harold&mdash;Perry, and Jackson
Carter, both Juniors at the University of
Florida.</p>

<p>"We're both on the archery team at college,"
Jackson explained. "And we take a little trip
into the Okefenokee each summer, to try out our
bows and arrows on the wild game here. We
camp each night on one of the islands."</p>

<p>"Then you know the Swamp pretty well,"
remarked Linda, with relief. They would be
able to take her back to civilization.</p>

<p>"The southern end of it&mdash;yes," replied Hal.</p>

<p>"Now tell us who you are," urged Jackson
Carter, regarding Linda with silent admiration.
There was no doubt about it, she certainly was
an attractive girl.</p>

<p>Linda hesitated a moment, and determined
not to mention her first name. She was tired of
all the publicity and disaster which her ocean
flight had brought her. Besides, these boys
might think she was just posing as Linda Carlton,
the famous aviatrix, in order to impress
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
them. She would tell them only her middle
name, instead.</p>

<p>"I am Ann Carlton, from Ohio," she replied.
"I was flying my new plane when I got lost
over the swamp, and had to come down on the
first dry land I saw, because my gas was running
low, and I didn't know how far the water
extended."</p>

<p>"Smashed your plane?" inquired Hal, evidently
satisfied with the explanation.</p>

<p>"No. But unfortunately I fell among a gang
of thieves, and they stole it, and tried to hold
me prisoner on Black Jack Island. But yesterday
I got away, as I told you."</p>

<p>Both boys gazed at Linda in admiration and
wonder. What a plucky girl she must be!</p>

<p>"Thieves in the swamp!" repeated Hal. "Not
Indians?&mdash;a lot of Indians used to live here,
and they might have come back."</p>

<p>"No. White men&mdash;and one girl. Regular
thieves, the kind that rob banks and jewelry
stores."</p>

<p>"But what were they doing? Hiding from justice?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," answered Linda. "Because
I don't think anybody suspects them in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
particular. They have a regular camp on Black
Jack Island, and they bring whatever they steal
there, and transfer it by airplane to an island
in the Atlantic Ocean, where it's picked up by
another partner in a boat."</p>

<p>Jackson let out a whistle.</p>

<p>"Pretty slick, aren't they? But they'll get
caught sometime."</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope so. Unfortunately, though,
nobody could identify them as thieves, because
they haven't been caught before."</p>

<p>"You could," remarked Hal.</p>

<p>"Yes, if I ever see them again. Do we have
to pass Black Jack Island to get out of the
swamp?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so&mdash;but we needn't go very close
to it&mdash;it's some distance from the regular 'Gator
Road' we always follow."</p>

<p>"'Gator Road'?" repeated Linda. "There
aren't any roads in the swamp, are there?"</p>

<p>"They're water channels," Hal explained.
"Short for alligator-roads."</p>

<p>Linda shuddered.</p>

<p>"I saw an alligator last night," she told them.
"I hope we don't meet any more."</p>

<p>"You poor girl!" exclaimed Jackson. "It
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
seems to me you've had most every dreadful
experience anybody could have in the last
twenty-four hours!"</p>

<p>"But they're over now," laughed Linda, wondering
what the boys would say if she told them
the real account of the kidnapping.</p>

<p>Even now Jackson Carter was looking at her
strangely. She seemed like such a nice girl&mdash;but
what sort of family could she have come
from, that would allow her to roam around the
country unchaperoned and alone? He himself
was of an old-fashioned Southern family, who
regarded such independence in young women
as mere boldness. Yet Linda Carlton seemed
anything but ill-bred, or bold.</p>

<p>"Aren't your family worried about you, Miss
Carlton?" he inquired. "So far away&mdash;in an
airplane?"</p>

<p>"They must be by now," she replied with a
pang of distress. "I had promised to wire them
every day&mdash;and it's been three nights now since
I could. My aunt probably is afraid I have been
killed."</p>

<p>"Your aunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My mother is dead, and my aunt has
always taken care of me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"But she lets you do pretty much as you
please I take it. You northern girls certainly are
different."</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly." Linda could not explain
without telling the whole story of her life, so
she decided to let the matter pass. "Hadn't we
better be pushing on, if we expect to get out of
the swamp before dark?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hal. "But don't set your
heart on that, Miss Carlton. I don't know
whether we can or not. But we'll get past Black
Jack Island, and at least as far as Soldiers'
Camp Island."</p>

<p>"Soldiers' Camp Island?" repeated Linda.</p>

<p>"Yes. The story goes that some Civil War
soldiers deserted, and hid there. I don't know
how true it is, but it certainly is a good place
to hide."</p>

<p>"Don't I know!" sighed Linda.</p>

<p>They climbed into the canoe, putting Linda on
some blankets in the center, and started upon
their journey. For the first time since her visit
to the swamp, Linda was at last able to enjoy
its beauty. The thick ferns, the cypress trees
growing in abundance, the pines and the water-lilies!
What a difference a boat could make!
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Yesterday she hated the rushes and the moss;
today she found everything lovely.</p>

<p>Avoiding the island where the thieves were
camped, the boys made a wide circle, and did
not pass even in sight of it. With each mile of
progress, Linda's spirits rose higher and
higher, until finally she suggested that they
sing. She just had to find some outlet for her
joy and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"It must be long after noon," remarked Jackson,
as they finished a familiar college song.
"Hadn't we better eat?"</p>

<p>"I see an island ahead&mdash;I think it's Soldiers'
Camp," replied Hal. "Wouldn't it be nice to
stop and make some coffee?"</p>

<p>"I'm hot enough without any fire or hot coffee,"
returned Jackson, wiping the perspiration
from his face. "But I would like to stretch my
legs."</p>

<p>"Let me do the cooking!" urged Linda,
eagerly. "I'd love to prove some use to you,
after all the trouble I've made."</p>

<p>"You haven't been any trouble!" protested
Jackson, whose admiration for Linda had been
growing by leaps and bounds, in spite of the
fact that he could not wholly approve of her.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
For the past three hours he had been sitting in
the stern of the canoe, gazing at her lovely profile,
listening to the charm of her soft voice.
Yet he knew he had better not allow himself to
care for this girl; she was just the type his
mother disapproved of, and with Jackson Carter,
his mother's wishes were supreme.</p>

<p>They pulled up to the island and unloaded
the canoe. There were all sorts of supplies&mdash;bacon,
canned beans, fruit, and biscuits, as well
as tea, coffee, sugar and canned milk. Even a
little folding stove to set over a fire, and a coffee-pot.</p>

<p>"What a perfectly delightful spot!" exclaimed
Linda, as she walked some distance inland.
"Look at these lovely little houses! Why,
I could almost live in them myself!"</p>

<p>What she referred to were the clumps, here
and there, of cypress trees and overgrowing
vines and evergreens, which, as a matter of fact,
the hunters often used to camp in during their
visits to the swamp. They were very attractive
indeed, and would afford complete privacy,
Linda thought, if she were obliged to spend another
night in the Okefenokee.</p>

<p>The boys made a fire on the edge of the water,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and Linda insisted that they go off for half an
hour while she prepared the meal. She laughed
and sang as she toasted the dry biscuits and the
bacon, and boiled the coffee. What fun it was
to picnic when you were among friends&mdash;even
if they were very new ones!</p>

<p>When the boys came back, they each proudly
displayed a wild goose, as proof of their ability
with the bow and arrow. Then, like three happy,
carefree school-children, they sat down to their
meal, having forgotten all about the thieves for
the time being.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The shock was all the more terrible, therefore,
when they suddenly looked up into the
sky and saw the autogiro overhead. Linda was
the first to identify the plane, to guess what
danger they were in. She stumbled to her feet,
pulling Jackson with her, and just as she opened
her mouth to tell them to flee with her into the
depths of the island, a shot rang out from the
autogiro, and a bullet whizzed past the little
group, so innocently enjoying their picnic!</p>

<h2><a id="Chapter_VII"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII</span></a><br /><br />

<i>The Smash-Up</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>The robbery which was so carefully planned
by the gang of thieves who had kidnapped Linda
Carlton, was highly successful. One of the largest
banks in Jacksonville was entered just before
closing time on the afternoon of June 23rd
by four masked robbers, who calmly took thousands
of dollars in cash and securities, and
escaped to a waiting car, without being identified
or caught.</p>

<p>By a secret route these men suddenly disappeared&mdash;whither,
no one but Linda and Susie
knew. By midnight they were back again in the
swamp, and by dawn they had reached Black
Jack Island.</p>

<p>Exhausted from their journey, three of the
men dropped down on their cots and fell instantly
asleep. The fourth&mdash;Susie's husband&mdash;stopped
to look into his wife's tent.</p>

<p>Flashing the light inside, he peered through
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the doorway. There was Susie, sleeping peacefully
on her cot. But the other bed was empty!
"Susie!" he yelled in alarm. "Where's
Linda?"</p>

<p>The girl awakened abruptly, and sat up,
blinking her eyes at the unexpected light. For
a moment she could not think what he meant.
Then she remembered her prisoner.</p>

<p>"She's gone," she replied. "Beat it this afternoon."</p>

<p>"How?" he demanded roughly, coming over
and shaking her by the arm. Susie winced, and
pulled herself free.</p>

<p>"You leave me alone!" she warned him.
"How do I know how Linda got away? Could I
run after her?"</p>

<p>"No, but you might 'ave watched her!"
snarled Slats. "Didn't I tell you to?"</p>

<p>"Watching wouldn't keep her here," retorted
Susie.</p>

<p>"Is her Bug still there?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I hobbled over and took a look myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you?" Then, worn out and
disappointed, Slats started to swear.</p>

<p>Susie sat still, regarding him with contempt.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
How vulgar such language sounded, when you
actually stopped and listened to it! She did not
realize it at the time, but just the few hours
which she had spent with Linda Carlton had
given her a new view-point. Or rather, had
brought back her training as a child, before
she had "gone bad."</p>

<p>When the man's anger had spent itself in
violent words, he began to wonder how on earth
Linda could have escaped.</p>

<p>"No human being could get far in this here
bog, without a boat or a plane!" he exclaimed.
"She must be around here somewhere."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go look for her!" demanded
Susie, with a sneer. She was beginning to be
glad that Linda had gotten away.</p>

<p>Her husband turned on her savagely.</p>

<p>"Look a here, Susie, if you helped that kid
to get away&mdash;!" He held up his fist threateningly.
"I'll make you sorry! Give you a dose
of the medicine I was saving for Linda!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded, trembling.</p>

<p>"This gun!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't," she hastened to assure him.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
"Linda slipped off when I wasn't watching.... But do you mean you
were going to shoot Linda?"</p>

<p>"Sure, you fool! That's what kidnappers always
do. Bait the big fish till they get the cash,
then kill the victim, and ship the corpse. If we
sent Linda back alive, she'd have us in the Pen
in no time. Our game'd be up."</p>

<p>Susie shivered; she had not realized that the
men had any intention of going to that end.
True, Slats had once killed a bank messenger,
but Susie always excused him on the ground of
self-defense. "Hard-boiled" as she was, the
idea of shooting an innocent girl like Linda
Carlton was too much for her to approve. She
felt suddenly sick with the horror of it all.</p>

<p>Slats sat down for a moment on the empty
cot, while he thought things over. Linda Carlton
must not escape to tell the world of her
experience and to give such accurate descriptions
of the gang that they would have to be
caught. Aside from the matter of the ransom
which the kidnapping ought to bring them, they
dared not let her go. The case called for immediate
action.</p>

<p>"Can you fly that Bug, Susie?" he demanded,
abruptly breaking the silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess so," replied the girl. "They say
they're easier than airplanes."</p>

<p>"O.K. Then we're off. Get dressed as quick
as you can."</p>

<p>"But Slats," protested Susie, rubbing her
injured ankle, "don't forget I've been hurt!"</p>

<p>"Rats!" was his unsympathetic reply. "Get
busy. I'll be getting the gas, and some grub.
We'll need coffee&mdash;and a lot of it."</p>

<p>Distasteful as the plan was, Susie could do
nothing but obey. But she was feeling very
miserable as she ate her breakfast, very sorry
for the "poor, brave kid," as she called Linda,
very resentful against her husband.</p>

<p>The latter helped her down to the autogiro
and put her into the pilot's cock-pit, where she
sat for some minutes examining the controls.
The dawn had changed into daylight, and the
swamp was beautiful in the early morning sunrise.
But, like Linda Carlton, Susie did not even
notice it.</p>

<p>Impatient at the delay, her husband demanded,
"Got the idea how to run her?"</p>

<p>"Sure," she replied, listlessly. "Start her up
and climb in.... Where do you want to go!"</p>

<p>"Circle all around&mdash;flying low, so that we can
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
spot the kid if she's here. If we don't see her in
the water, we'll stop at some of the islands, and
look there. She can't 'ave got out of this
swamp."</p>

<p>"O.K.," agreed Susie.</p>

<p>Without much difficulty the girl ran the autogiro
along the edge of the island until it rose
into the air. It was easy enough to keep it
flying; the test would come when she had to
make a landing. But Susie decided never to
worry about anything until the time came. Luck
was usually with her; her only serious crash had
been the one of two days previous, and, after
all, there was a reason for that.</p>

<p>Slats, who spurned learning how to fly, because
he considered his a master-mind, above
such practical work, was, nevertheless, enjoying
the ride. He congratulated himself upon his
own cleverness in securing this new plane for
the gang.</p>

<p>"Like her, Susie?" he shouted, through the
speaking-tube.</p>

<p>The girl nodded, indifferently.</p>

<p>"You can have her!" he announced, proudly,
as if he were giving her a costly present of his
own purchasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Susie drew down the corners of her lips in
scorn, but made no reply. Didn't he realize that
she would never dare fly this autogiro where
anyone could see her? That the police all over
the country would be on the look-out for this
very plane? She was understanding for the
first time that money was not much use without
freedom.</p>

<p>As she sat in the cock-pit, silently thinking
things over, she made up her mind not to try
to help Slats in his search. She would have to
continue to guide the plane, of course, for she
never for one moment forgot the pistol that
her husband kept ready to enforce his orders
with. But she would not attempt to spot Linda,
nor would she inform him if she did happen
by chance to see the girl. No; it would be better
to let "the poor kid" die by natural causes in
the swamp than for her to be killed by Slats in
cold-blooded murder.</p>

<p>Over the trees and tropical plants of the
swamp they continued to fly, until the sun rose
directly overhead, and they knew that it was
noon. All the while Slats kept his eyes glued
to the ground, without any success. Not a sign
of human life did he see. Movements in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
swamp&mdash;yes&mdash;snakes and birds, and even an
alligator&mdash;but no girl! Yet he felt sure that
even if Linda were hiding, she would come out
at the sound of the plane, for by this time she
would realize that escape was impossible.
Driven by the pangs of hunger, she would have
to surrender to her fate. But noon passed, and
they found no trace of her.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was dead by this time, the man
thought bitterly&mdash;killed by a snake, or drowned
in the treacherous water! He would not mind
that, if he could only find her dead body. Without
it, without the assurance that she was not
still at large, he dared not seek a reward. What
a lot of money he would be losing!</p>

<p>"We'll land on an island, and have some
grub," he shouted to his companion. "Fly
south to 'Soldiers' Camp.'"</p>

<p>"O.K.," replied the girl, beginning to doubt
her ability to make a landing. But she was
afraid to disobey&mdash;and besides, they had to
come down sometime.</p>

<p>After that things happened with a rapidity
that must have startled the peaceful bird-life
in the Okefenokee Swamp. Approaching the
island, Susie and her husband spotted the carefree
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
picnic at the same moment, and the former
made a sudden, sharp turn in the hope of hiding
the sight from Slats. At the same instant, he
took out his pistol and fired at the group&mdash;at
Linda in particular&mdash;missing her only because
of Susie's rapid change of the position of the
plane.</p>

<p>The sharp angle had its effect upon the pilot;
she lurched over, striking her injured ankle
against the rudder, swerving the plane violently
to the other side. Panic-stricken, she tried to
right the plane, but she had not even throttled
the engine down to a landing speed. The inevitable
crash followed. With an impact that
was frightful, the autogiro headed for a tree
with relentless speed, struck it and bounced
thirty feet into the air.</p>

<p>By some miracle Susie, crouched as she was
in the cock-pit, was not thrown out, but her
husband, who had not taken the precaution to
wear a safety-belt, was bounced wildly into the
air, and landed, face-downward, on a rock.</p>

<p>During all this excitement, Linda and her
companions stood tensely rooted to the spot,
the girl gripping Jackson Carter's hand as if
he were her one support. As the crash came,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
she dropped her head on his shoulder and
moaned aloud, totally unconscious of the fact
that the young man was still little more than
a stranger to her.</p>

<p>A cry from Susie aroused her to the fact
that the girl was still alive. Ignoring the man
who had brought about the catastrophe by his
hasty shot, all three young people rushed to
Susie's aid.</p>

<p>The plane was only partially turned over;
the rotor and the wheels were injured, and the
nose smashed, but it did not look to Linda as if
there had been any serious harm to the engine.
Susie's head was cut, and two teeth were
knocked out, but apparently no bones had been
broken. Very carefully the boys lifted her from
the cock-pit and laid her on the ground.</p>

<p>"I have a first-aid kit in the canoe," said Hal,
immediately. "I'll get it and fix up this cut. It
doesn't seem awfully deep."</p>

<p>"Does it hurt very much, Susie?" asked
Linda, offering her a drink of water.</p>

<p>"Not as much as my ankle. And my poor
mouth! Without these teeth! My looks are
ruined!"</p>

<p>"No, they're not," answered Linda, comfortingly.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
"Any good dentist can fix you up so
nobody will ever know the difference."</p>

<p>Still no one said anything about the man who
was lying so silently on the rock a dozen yards
away. It was Hal Perry, returning from the
canoe, who made the announcement which they
had all been secretly expecting.</p>

<p>"The man with the gun is dead," he said,
quietly, not knowing how Susie would take the
news.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"So he got his at last," muttered the latter,
with a certain grim satisfaction. "Nobody&mdash;not
even his widow&mdash;is goin' to shed a single
tear!"</p>

<i>The Chief of Police</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Half an hour after the accident, Susie expressed
a desire to eat, and Linda hastened to
supply her with food. While the girl ate her
lunch, the little group discussed their plans.</p>

<p>"Is my bag still in the autogiro?" asked
Linda, surveying the disreputable suit which
she had worn for three days. What a relief it
would be to get into clean clothing!</p>

<p>"It was when we left," replied Susie. "If it
didn't bounce out when we crashed....
Linda," she added apologetically, "I'm awful
sorry about your plane. I&mdash;I&mdash;didn't mean to
crack it up."</p>

<p>"I know you didn't, Susie. I think it can be
repaired, if we can get the new parts to this
forsaken place. Probably we can&mdash;by airplane."</p>

<p>Jackson Carter, who had been only half listening
to this conversation, interrupted by telling
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the girls that he and Hal would take care
of the burying of the criminal. "Unless," he
added, turning to Susie, "you would want to
take the body back to your home?"</p>

<p>"We haven't any home," Susie admitted
sadly. "And no friends, outside the gang....
No, it's better for him to lie here in this swamp&mdash;where
he meant to plant Linda."</p>

<p>The implication was lost to the boys, who
did not know the story of the kidnapping, and
who thought of Linda as "Ann."</p>

<p>"Then first we'll help you get your bag out
of the autogiro, Miss Carlton," offered Jackson.
"You can go back into one of those little
'houses,' and change into clean clothing, if you
want to, while we attend to the burying."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," urged Linda. "I think we
ought to decide what we'll do about tonight. We
can't all four get into that canoe, so Susie and
I had better stay here, hadn't we? You could
wire my aunt for me, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>To Linda's amazement, before either of the
boys had a chance to reply, Susie put in a protest.</p>

<p>"It ain't safe for you to be here an hour more
than you have to," she said. "Don't forget
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
there's still three rough guys hot on your trail....
No, I'll stay alone, if you leave me some
grub, and a blanket. You can come back for me
when you bring somebody to fix your plane."
This generous offer came as a complete surprise
to Linda; she had not realized before that this
girl had swung over to her side. What a splendid
sign it was! Susie must have decided to cut
free from these criminals, now that her husband
was dead.</p>

<p>"That's great of you, Susie," replied Linda.
"And you needn't worry that I'll ever tell the
authorities anything bad about you! I was
afraid I oughtn't to leave you alone&mdash;but if you
really don't mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other girl shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'll get along O.K. I'm used to being left
by myself. But don't stay away too long."</p>

<p>The arrangements suited the boys perfectly,
for they were anxious to be out of the swamp
as soon as possible. With fast paddling, they
ought to be able to reach a little town in Florida
by dark, where they believed that they could
hire an automobile to take them home.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Linda stepped out from
the enclosure, dressed in a pale blue voile&mdash;the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
only dress she carried in her bag, for she had
shipped her trunk to Atlanta, where she had
expected to report for work. The wearing of
clean clothing was a pleasure second only to
that of using a comb and a tooth-brush. She
felt like a different girl.</p>

<p>If she had seemed pretty to Jackson Carter
before, in that disheveled green linen suit, she
was radiantly beautiful now. Returning from
his gruesome task, he stood still, lost in admiration.</p>

<p>Linda laughed at his amazement.</p>

<p>"Do I look like another girl?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"The same girl&mdash;glorified," he answered,
with awe.</p>

<p>Having unloaded the canoe of its food and
blankets, and assured themselves that Susie was
able to hobble around with the aid of a stick,
the three young people pushed off. It was only
three o'clock; all these occurrences&mdash;the crash,
the death of the criminal, his burial&mdash;had taken
place in less than two hours!</p>

<p>For some time the boys paddled forward in
silence, each of the three occupants of the canoe
lost in his or her own thoughts. Hal was going
over the exciting events of the last two hours;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Jackson was thinking of Linda&mdash;or "Ann"&mdash;Carlton,
and wondering whether her hiding her
head on his shoulder had meant that she cared
for him. Linda's mind, however, was occupied
with the immediate future&mdash;with the part she
might play in assisting the police to catch those
arch criminals who were still at large.</p>

<p>It was she who first broke the silence.</p>

<p>"What would be the nearest large city to
this southern end of the swamp?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Jacksonville, Florida," replied Hal, immediately.
"That's where we both live."</p>

<p>"Then that's where I want to go," announced
Linda. "Have they a good police department?"</p>

<p>"Best in the country," boasted Jackson....
"Miss Carlton," he added, "would you stay at
our home while you are in the city?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to," agreed the girl immediately.
All through the South, until she had lost her
way in the Okefenokee, she had met with this
same southern hospitality, and had found it
charming.</p>

<p>Jackson Carter was overjoyed at her acceptance,
yet he was a little fearful of the reception
his mother would give to a girl who was so
different from all his other friends. Surely,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
however, the older woman must see how fine
Miss Carlton was, and accept her for her own
lovely charm.</p>

<p>The hours passed swiftly and the daylight
was fast fading when the boys finally informed
Linda that she was out of the swamp. With a
prayer of thanksgiving, she gave it one last
look, hardly able to believe her good fortune.
Less than twenty-four hours ago, she had been
miserably lost in its depths. Now she was free
to live again in civilization, untortured by the
fears that had held her in such terror for the
last three days.</p>

<p>Leaving the canoe in a boat-house on the bank
of the small stream which they had been following
out of the swamp, they walked to the
nearest village and asked for the Post Office.
Here Linda made arrangements to send a wire
to her aunt, in which, however, she did not mention
the fact that she had been kidnapped.</p>

<p>"Have been lost in Okefenokee Swamp," she
wrote. "But not hurt. Wire me at Jacksonville,
Fla. Love&mdash;Linda."</p>

<p>Her next move was to send for her trunk from
Atlanta, and to wire for new parts for the autogiro,
and while the boys looked up a place to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
eat supper, she bought a Jacksonville newspaper.
She hoped there would be nothing in it
about her, for she hated so much publicity.</p>

<p>The first item that struck her eye was the
announcement of the Jacksonville Bank robbery.
More than a hundred thousand dollars had
been stolen&mdash;in cash and securities&mdash;by four
masked bandits on the afternoon of June
twenty-third, and still no trace of them had been
found.</p>

<p>"That money must be at Black Jack Island,"
she thought, resolving to get this information
to the police early the following day.</p>

<p>She had to go through the paper twice before
she found her own name. It was only a tiny
notice, among the aviation briefs, and copied
from an Ohio paper&mdash;stating the fact that Linda
Carlton, world-famous aviatrix, had not been
heard from for three days, and asking that the
air-ports of Georgia report any sight of her
autogiro.</p>

<p>Linda breathed a sigh of relief, as she saw
how inconspicuous this notice was. For some
reason she did not want Jackson Carter or Hal
Perry to connect her with the famous flyer, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
she longed above everything to keep the story
of the kidnapping from her aunt's ears.</p>

<p>The boys came back with the information that
they had found a place to eat, and took Linda
to a little frame house where a widow ran a
sort of restaurant. The cottage was run-down
and out-of-repair, but everything inside was
neat and clean, and the food, though plain, was
excellent.</p>

<p>"How long will it take us to get to Jacksonville?"
inquired Linda, as they finished the
meal.</p>

<p>"Two or three hours," replied Hal. "Providing
we have no mishaps. Why?"</p>

<p>Linda repressed a sigh. She was very tired,
and longed intensely for sleep in a real bed.
These last two nights in the swamp had taken
their toll of her vitality.</p>

<p>"If only we had a plane!" she said.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do me any good," remarked
Jackson. "I've never been in one&mdash;and I've
promised my grandmother I won't fly until I'm
twenty-one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," offered Linda, with
genuine sympathy. Life without flying seemed
a dreary thing to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The only car which the boys had been able
to hire was a dilapidated Ford that looked as
if it would hardly last the trip. But it proved
to be better than its appearance; over the lovely
hard roads of Florida it traveled comparatively
smoothly. To Linda's amazement, she found
when they reached Jacksonville that she had
slept most of the way.</p>

<p>The short rest had freshened her considerably,
and she suddenly decided to go to the
Police Headquarters that night. It was her duty
to report the crash of her plane, and the death
of that criminal. She wished that she had
thought to ask Susie his real name&mdash;she was
going to feel rather silly calling him "Slats."</p>

<p>With this purpose in mind, she asked Jackson
what time it was.</p>

<p>"Half-past nine," was his reply. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I think I ought to report to the
Police tonight about those thieves. I understand
that it was a bank in Jacksonville that they
robbed."</p>

<p>"Which bank?" demanded the boy, excitedly.</p>

<p>"'The First National,' the paper says."</p>

<p>At this information, Jackson Carter dropped
back in his seat and groaned. His mother's bank
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
&mdash;where all of her money was kept! The bank
of which his uncle was president! This was going
to mean trouble to the whole Carter family.</p>

<p>"Will you please take my bag to your house,
and leave the address with me?" asked Linda,
not knowing what Jackson was suffering. "I'll
take a taxi out to your home, after I see the
Chief of Police."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course," agreed the young man,
still absorbed in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>It was a late hour to visit the Chief of Police,
but when Linda explained her reason to an officer
at the City Hall, the latter sent for the chief
immediately.</p>

<p>When Captain Magee came in a few minutes
later, Linda was impressed with his appearance
and delighted with his dignified and courteous
manner. She smiled at him confidently;
how different he was from those officers of the
law with whom she had come in contact in
Canada!</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you my whole story, if you
will promise not to repeat the part about the
kidnapping to the newspapers," she began. "I
don't want my people at home to hear of that&mdash;for,
after all, it is over now, and I am safe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kidnapping!" repeated the officer. "You
don't mean to say that you have been kidnapped?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My name is Linda Ann Carlton&mdash;I am
the girl who flew the Atlantic in May." She
blushed, for she hated to talk about herself, or
to appear to boast about her own exploits, but
this time it was necessary. "Here in Jacksonville,
among friends, I am going to be known as
Ann Carlton, because I want to avoid publicity."
Her blue eyes became pleading, and she
asked, in an almost child-like tone, "You won't
tell on me, will you, Captain Magee?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "No, I won't tell. Unless it becomes
necessary."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much! Well, to continue: I
bought a new autogiro and flew down here to
report to a company in Atlanta about a job
spraying crops, and the newspapers printed the
route of my flight. Early in the evening of June
22nd I lost my way over the Okefenokee Swamp,
and finally landed on an island. A plane had
been chasing me, as I later learned after it
landed&mdash;or rather crashed&mdash;beside mine. The
man in it held me at the point of a gun and
compelled me to fly my autogiro to their camp
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
on Black Jack Island, where I was to be held
for a ransom. <i>That man was the chief of the
gang of bandits that robbed the Jacksonville
bank.</i>"</p>

<p>She paused a moment for breath, and the
Captain leaned forward eagerly. The story,
which might have seemed incredulous to an
ordinary person, was perfectly believable to
him. He was used to the ways of criminals.</p>

<p>"But how did you get away?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I never should have, if it hadn't been for
this bank robbery," she explained. "While the
men went off, I escaped, and was picked up by
a couple of Jacksonville boys in a canoe."</p>

<p>Linda went on to relate the happenings of
the afternoon, concluding with the death of the
ring-leader of the gang, whom she knew only as
"Slats." She spoke lightly of Susie, showing
her merely as a weak pawn in her husband's
hands.</p>

<p>The criminals' method of disposing of their
stolen valuables was another interesting point
in her story, and she told Captain Magee about
the barren island in the ocean.</p>

<p>"Now whether this stuff is still on the island
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
or at the camp," she concluded, "I don't know.
But I am ready to go and help you find out."</p>

<p>"You mean you are actually willing to go
back into that swamp?" the officer asked. "To
show us the way?"</p>

<p>"Of course! That's why I came to you tonight.
So that we can make arrangements for
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"But it may be very dangerous, Miss Carlton!
These men will be armed, and will shoot
at sight."</p>

<p>"I'll take a chance. Can we go tomorrow
morning? By plane?"</p>

<p>"By airplane?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Any other way would be too slow. They
may have escaped already."</p>

<p>"But an airplane will be so much noisier than
a boat. They'll hear you coming."</p>

<p>"We'll have to take that chance." She stood
up. "If you will get a plane, Captain Magee&mdash;a
large one&mdash;I will fly it, to save space. Then
we can take two or three armed guards."</p>

<p>"How do you know that you can fly any plane
I happen to get, Miss Carlton?" he inquired,
incredulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see, I'm a transport pilot," she explained.
"We have to be able to manage most
anything.... Can you send a car out for me
to the Carters' home, early in the morning?"
She handed the Captain the address.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll telephone as soon as I can make
all the arrangements," he agreed, seeing that
he could not change her from her purpose.</p>

<p>Linda thanked him and hurried out to the
waiting taxi. It was growing late, long after
ten o'clock, and she was anxious to be in bed.</p>

<p>Jackson Carter himself came to the door
when she rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Where is your mother?" she asked, immediately,
for there was no sign of a hostess inside.</p>

<p>"She is ill," replied the young man. "The
bad news about the bank&mdash;a great deal of our
money was lost&mdash;knocked her terribly. She
hasn't told grandmother, or it might kill her.
So I had the maid get the guest room ready, and
hope that you will excuse them both."</p>

<p>Linda nodded; she had no way of knowing
that Mrs. Carter had protested about entertaining
this girl whom Jackson had "picked
up" on his canoe trip, and had stubbornly refused
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to see her. The woman had worked herself
into such a state of nerves over her losses
and over this incident that she had actually
made herself ill.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," said Linda, sympathetically.
"If I weren't so tired, I'd go to a hotel, for this
is no time for your mother to be bothered with
a guest. But I'll just stay tonight, and leave
early tomorrow. I'm flying to the swamp again
with the police officers."</p>

<p>"Ann!" cried Jackson aghast, using her name
unconsciously. "Don't, please! It's dangerous&mdash;you
may be killed.... And, and, besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides, what?"</p>

<p>"Besides, it isn't done. You shouldn't go off
to lonely places like that, without an older woman
along."</p>

<p>Linda smiled.</p>

<p>"I can't be bothered with social codes at a
time like this," she said. "I have to do all I can
to get that money back. Think of the hundreds
of people hurt by that bank robbery&mdash;if the
bank is forced to close its doors! Including your
own mother and grandmother! No, I just have
to go."</p>

<p>"Let me go instead," he suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wouldn't know just where the camp is.
It's pretty well hidden, and I know the only
spot where a landing is possible. Besides, you
can't fly a plane."</p>

<p>"You mean you will pilot the plane yourself?
Your autogiro's broken."</p>

<p>"Oh, it'll be another plane&mdash;a hired one. Now
please don't argue any more, Mr. Carter&mdash;you
sound like my aunt&mdash;and let me go to bed. And
will you ask one of the servants to waken me at
seven o'clock?"</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Good night, then, Miss Carlton," he said,
almost sorrowfully, for it seemed like the end
of what might have been a wonderful friendship
for Jackson Carter.</p>

<i>Two Prisoners</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Linda's telephone call came early the following
morning, and after a simple breakfast
served by the cook, she left in the car which
Captain Magee sent. Not one of the Carter
family appeared at the meal, and there was no
message of any kind. Linda, however, attributed
this to Mrs. Carter's illness, and wrote a
polite note of thanks to her hostess.</p>

<p>She found three plain-clothes men waiting
for her at the police station, and they joined
her in the car which then took them to the airport.
A large cabin plane, capable of accommodating
six persons, had been wheeled out on
the runway, awaiting their arrival and two
service men were standing beside it.</p>

<p>"You are sure you can pilot her, Miss?"
inquired one of these men, skeptically.</p>

<p>Linda opened her bag and took out her two
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
licenses&mdash;mechanic's and transport pilot's&mdash;and
handed them to him.</p>

<p>"A mechanic!" he exclaimed, in amazement.
"Gee whiz! Will wonders never cease? It's the
first time I ever laid eyes on a lady-mechanic!"</p>

<p>Linda laughed.</p>

<p>"May I look the plane over before we start?"
she asked. "And will you map out the quickest
course to Okefenokee Swamp! I want to get
into the southern part of it&mdash;Black Jack Island,
if you know where that is."</p>

<p>With a grin the man disappeared to consult
some one in the hangar, and Linda went ahead
with the examination.</p>

<p>"There ought to be plenty of room in here
to bring back any prisoners we may get," she
said, cheerfully. "I think too, that you had
better send for some food and water, Sergeant&mdash;for
we can't tell how long we may be gone."</p>

<p>When she announced herself satisfied with
the inspection, she and her three companions
climbed into the cabin while the mechanic fired
the engine. The plane taxied along the runway
and rose gracefully into the air, to the admiration
of the three officers, none of whom could
fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're there with the goods, Miss Carlton!"
shouted the one named "Worth," who apparently
was in charge of the expedition.</p>

<p>"Don't praise me too soon," returned Linda.
"That was child's play. But wait till it comes
to landing on that island in the swamp. There
is only one spot big enough, in a plane like
this."</p>

<p>"Well, we got plenty of gas," remarked
Worth, cheerfully. "I'm not afraid. I'm enjoying
the flight. It isn't every day that we go up
in the skies on our job."</p>

<p>Linda was enjoying it, too. She flew carefully,
watching her map, her instruments, and
the landscape below. They flew over the island
where they had left Susie, and Linda made a
mental note of the location, in case she should
be able to pick the girl up on the return trip.</p>

<p>It was difficult to keep her direction, for the
swamp, covered as it was with grasses and trees,
seemed like an unbroken, monotonous expanse
from the air, but Linda had succeeded in spotting
the little stream down which the boys had
paddled the canoe, and she resolved to follow
that to the place where they had picked her up.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
After that it ought to be easy to locate Black
Jack Island and the camp of the thieves.</p>

<p>But it was not as simple as she had hoped,
even after she had located the island. Again
and again she circled about, looking for a space
large enough to make a landing. Finally she
found what must be the edge of the island, for
the water came up unevenly, but this beach appeared
very small. It was one thing to bring the
autogiro safely to earth in a place like this, and
another to land a big plane.</p>

<p>When she had selected her spot, she determined
to try "fish-tailing." She glided with
considerable speed toward her field; as she approached
it, she swung her airplane from side
to side, exposing the flat side of the plane's
body to the air so as to kill the speed.</p>

<p>Her companions, who had no idea what she
was doing, looked at Linda in alarm. Had she
lost control of the plane, and were they about
to be dashed to pieces?</p>

<p>But a glance at their pilot's calm, confident
expression allayed their fears. This girl knew
what she was doing! They need not be afraid.</p>

<p>Often at the ground school she had been compelled
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to land on a given spot&mdash;such as a square
of canvas; it was no wonder that she now felt
sure of herself. A moment later she came down
on the very mark that she had selected.</p>

<p>"Pretty neat!" exclaimed Worth, in admiration.</p>

<p>Linda turned off the engine and prepared to
get out of the plane. But the Sergeant stopped
her.</p>

<p>"You stay in here, Miss Carlton!" he ordered.
"This is no place for a girl."</p>

<p>"But I have to show you where the camp is,"
she protested.</p>

<p>"Then show us from here! And remember,
too, that you are our pilot. If anything happened
to you, we couldn't get out of this swamp."</p>

<p>Linda saw the reasoning in this last argument,
and agreed to remain inside of the cabin
until she should be summoned. She sat there
tensely, while the three men advanced cautiously
towards the trees at the center of the
island.</p>

<p>They had not gone more than a dozen yards
when a shot rang out from behind a tree, and
a bullet whizzed past over their heads. A cry
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
burst from Linda's lips, then an exclamation
of relief at the assurance that her companions
were unhurt.</p>

<p>"So they're still here!" she thought, excitedly,
clasping her hands so tightly together
that they grew numb with the pressure. "Oh,
if the men only get them without being shot!"</p>

<p>The officers' pistols replied rapidly to the
shot from the thieves, in such quick succession
that Linda could almost imagine that she was
in an actual war zone. But the volley lasted
only a moment, for the thieves were short of
bullets since "Slats'" disappearance, and before
anyone was hurt, "Beefy" and "Jake"
surrendered to Sergeant Worth.</p>

<p>Watching the whole proceeding from the window
of the plane, Linda drew a deep sigh of
relief. Then suddenly she remembered the third
member of the gang&mdash;the man nick-named
"Doc." Where was he? Hiding in the background,
waiting to shoot them all down when
they were off guard?</p>

<p>Cautiously, therefore, Linda leaned out of the
side of the plane and called to Sergeant Worth
to come back to her. Leaving the two thieves
in charge of the other men, who instantly handcuffed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
them, Worth returned to the airplane,
smiling over his easy victory.</p>

<p>With his assistance Linda jumped out of the
cabin and whispered her warning into his ear.
The man scowled in disappointment.</p>

<p>"This fellow may be waiting for you, Miss
Carlton," he said. "You stay right here&mdash;behind
the plane, while I go find out where he is."</p>

<p>Linda did as she was told, expecting every
moment to hear renewed shooting.</p>

<p>"Where's your other man?" she heard Worth
shout, as he approached the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Gone!" snarled Jake. "Two of 'em sneaked
off. Double-crossed us, and took the kale!"</p>

<p>"Money? What money?" demanded Worth,
instantly, hoping to surprise the man into a
confession.</p>

<p>"Nothin'. None of your business," muttered
Jake, seeing that he had made a mistake by
saying too much.</p>

<p>"You needn't try to hide anything," remarked
the officer, contemptuously. "We know
all about the bank robbery&mdash;and other jobs, too&mdash;that
you fellows can account for. You'll serve
plenty of time!"</p>

<p>Impatient at the delay, Linda felt that she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
had to be at the scene of action, to hear what
had happened to the "Doc," who evidently was
not on the island. She ran forward, just in time
to hear Jake's explanation.</p>

<p>"One fellow made off with the girl in the
plane yesterday morning," he said. "The other
guy must have beat it later on in the day&mdash;while
us two was still asleep. Took the boat and the
cash. We ain't got nothin' here of any value&mdash;outside
of food.... Huh! Why, if there ain't
Linda herself!"</p>

<p>Angry as she was at this insolent manner of
addressing her, Linda could not help smiling
at the man's consternation. But she was terribly
disappointed to learn that the money was gone.
That meant that they had failed to accomplish
the main purpose with which she had set out&mdash;to
restore to the innocent bank depositors the
savings which they had lost through no fault
of their own.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the money's over on the island in
the ocean," she suggested hopefully. "I had to
help bury some boxes of jewels there while I
was a prisoner&mdash;and those may still be there,
too. Shall we fly over immediately, Sergeant
Worth?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know the way?" the latter inquired, in
surprise. His admiration for this plucky girl
was growing every minute.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I think so. We can make these men
direct us if I forget. They are sure to know."</p>

<p>After a hasty search of Black Jack Island was
completed&mdash;to make sure that the third man
was not still in hiding&mdash;the party returned to
the airplane, and Linda made ready to take off
once more. This was an exceedingly difficult
feat, with a large plane, but the experienced
aviatrix calculated everything before she made
the attempt, and the airplane left the ground
at the exact time that she had planned. She
directed it eastward now, out over the Georgia
coast, on to the Atlantic. She remembered the
course perfectly, spotting the identical island
without any help from the prisoners, and landed
on the wide barren beach without any difficulty.</p>

<p>Once they were out of the plane she recalled
even the hiding-place, where "Slats" had
placed the jewels, and she led the way through
the underbrush. Unrolling the stone, and pushing
the sand aside at her direction, the detectives
brought out the three tin boxes which
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Linda herself had been forced to help conceal.</p>

<p>Opening them up right there by twisting the
locks, the officers gazed at their contents in
speechless amazement. Two diamond necklaces,
a string of real pearls, innumerable rings and
pins and watches. And a bracelet of priceless
emeralds!</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Sergeant Worth, the
perspiration running down his face.</p>

<p>"The Van Tyn diamonds!" declared one of
the detectives. "And these pearls solve the mystery
of that robbery at the Kenworthy estate!"</p>

<p>"Yeah. And that big jewelry store in Atlanta!"
added another, breathlessly. "Say,
does this uncover a lot of money? I'll tell the
world!"</p>

<p>"It'll mean a nice little reward for Miss Carlton,"
remarked Sergeant Worth, with a smile.</p>

<p>Linda shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, I don't want it," she said. "If there is
any reward, it can be divided among you men.
You faced the guns!"</p>

<p>"But Miss Carlton&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Linda held up her hand. "I mean it," she
said. "If you can't use it yourselves, perhaps
your wives&mdash;or your children can."</p>

<p>"It would mean heaven to me," murmured
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
one of the detectives&mdash;a quiet man, who had
scarcely spoken during the entire flight. "My
child needs an operation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it's settled," concluded Linda. Suddenly
she glanced timidly at Sergeant Worth,
almost as if she were about to ask a favor.
"Could we eat, Sergeant?" she asked. "I'm so
hungry."</p>

<p>"Why of course!" replied the latter. "I'm
sorry, I'd forgotten all about lunch&mdash;but it
must be way past noon. Griggs," he added to
one of his men, "you go and unload that basket."</p>

<p>It was an oddly assorted group that sat down
to that picnic lunch on the beach&mdash;the two
thieves, the three police officers, and the slender,
fair-haired girl in her linen flying suit. Linda
could not help smiling to herself as she thought
of what Jackson Carter's horror would be at
her association with people like these. Yet how
foolish he was! One look at Sergeant Worth's
face, kindly as it was, assured her that she was
well protected with him at her side.</p>

<p>She wished that she might stop at Soldiers'
Camp Island on the return trip, but it was out
of her way, and already the plane was loaded
to its capacity. So she mapped her return trip in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
a straight line back to the city of Jacksonville.
Late that afternoon she landed at the airport,
where the group separated, the detectives and
the prisoners taking one taxi to the police station,
Linda taking another to a hotel.</p>

<p>It was only when she was quietly in her own
room, with her bag unpacked, that she realized
how tired she was. What a strain she had been
through! How she longed for relaxation of some
kind! If only she had Louise with her&mdash;or somebody
else from Spring City!</p>

<p>She rested for an hour before dinner, but the
thought of eating alone was not pleasant, with
only a newspaper for her companion. She
brightened, however, when the idea came to her
to call her Aunt Emily on the long-distance
wire. It would mean a great deal to hear that
dear, familiar voice.</p>

<p>She did not have time after dinner to put in
the call immediately, for just as she was leaving
the dining-room, she was herself summoned
to the telephone. Who could it be, she wondered.
Nothing interesting, probably, for none of her
friends knew where to get her. No doubt it was
Captain Magee, congratulating her on the success
of the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>To her surprise, it was Jackson Carter who
said, "Hello!</p>

<p>"Can I drive in to the hotel to see you, Ann?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"How is your mother, Mr. Carter?" she inquired,
instead of answering his question.</p>

<p>"She's all right."</p>

<p>"Am I to meet her?"</p>

<p>The young man coughed in embarrassment.
He would have liked to have kept the truth from
her, but he could not lie to a girl like Linda Carlton,
any more than he could lie to his mother.</p>

<p>"I guess I better tell you, Ann&mdash;mother's
old-fashioned&mdash;and&mdash;she doesn't approve of
you. She says I may not invite you out here
again. I'm awfully sorry&mdash;I've tried to make
her understand&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Please don't bother," interrupted Linda,
coolly. "Perhaps it is better that an acquaintance
like ours end as casually as it started....
Good-by, Mr. Carter. And thank you again
for rescuing me."</p>

<p>"Ann! Ann! I can't let you go out of my
life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she had quietly replaced the receiver.</p>

<p>The tears came to her eyes, but she told herself
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
that she was foolish. She would probably
have to get used to things like this, if she meant
to do a man's work in the world. It was worth
it. Oh, the glorious feeling of power which she
had experienced that morning when she stepped
into that huge plane, and knew that she could
control its flight! The satisfaction of conquering
difficulties, solving problems, being of use
to others as she had been today! Yes, it was
worth all the snubs of every society woman in
the United States!</p>

<p>For a moment she sat beside the telephone,
waiting to get control of herself, when she suddenly
heard a beloved voice behind her. Two
voices&mdash;three voices&mdash;then two pairs of arms
around her neck! Dot Crowley's and Louise
Mackay's&mdash;and Ted was standing behind them!</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gasped, squeezing both girls at
once. "Am I dreaming? It's too good to be
true!"</p>

<p>"Are you O.K., darling?" demanded Louise,
kissing her chum again and again. "When we
read about your long flight south, and then
heard nothing of you for three days, we got
worried. So we managed to hop off."</p>

<p>"You angels!" cried Linda. "Oh, I might
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
have known you would! When everything
looked blackest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean about being lost in the Okefenokee
Swamp?"</p>

<p>"Worse than that.... Let me call Aunt
Emily, while you get a room, and I'll tell you
the whole story after that.... But first tell me
how long you can stay."</p>

<p>"Ted and I can only stay till tomorrow morning,"
replied Louise, "so long as you are all
right. But Dot'll keep you company&mdash;she
thought you might be lonely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That isn't half of it!" interrupted Linda.
"I was so lonely tonight that I couldn't eat. I
just felt sick. Worse, far worse than my flight
to France, because that was over quickly, and
this just seemed to stretch out interminably."</p>

<p>"Now do call your Aunt," urged Dot. "She
must be dying to hear from you&mdash;and we'll have
you all evening. By the way, I'm rooming with
you?"</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Nowhere else in the world!" exclaimed
Linda, giving the girl an extra hug in her joy.
"Room 420&mdash;and I'll be there in a minute!"</p>

<i>Susie Disappears</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>When Linda entered her hotel bed-room after
the conversation with her Aunt Emily over the
long-distance wire, she found two pleasant surprises
awaiting her. The first of these that she
saw was her trunk, sent on from Atlanta. The
second was a telegram from the Pitcairn Autogiro
Company.</p>

<p>Her new roommate, who was bending over
her own suit-case, looked up expectantly.</p>

<p>"Good news, Linda?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" replied the other girl. "The
parts for my 'Ladybug' have been shipped
from Miami, where the company has some autogiros
on exhibition. They'll be at the Jacksonville
Airport tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Then your Ladybug is damaged?" asked
Dot, who had heard nothing of the story as yet,
beyond the bare facts that had been in the
newspapers. All that she had read was that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Linda Carlton, famous aviatrix, who had been
lost in the Okefenokee Swamp for several days,
had turned up in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a smash-up," answered Linda.
"But I wasn't in it. Another girl was flying&mdash;&mdash;"
She stopped abruptly. "Wait till Lou
and Ted are with us, Dot, so I can tell the story
all at once. I'm rather fed up with it myself.
I'd loads rather hear what you've been doing
at Spring City."</p>

<p>"O.K.," agreed her companion, cheerfully,
and proceeded to report to Linda all the news
that she could remember.</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," remarked Linda,
a few minutes later, as she unpacked her trunk
and took a flowered chiffon which she decided
to wear, "is how everyone finds me at this
hotel. I didn't know where I'd be staying when
I sent those telegrams yesterday."</p>

<p>"I can answer that," replied Dot, immediately.
"It's your friends at the City Hall. The
Chief of Police there directed us. It was Ted's
idea to go to him, for I never would have
thought of it."</p>

<p>"Ted knows that Lou and I have a failing
for police stations and Court Houses," laughed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Linda, recalling their experience in Canada the
previous winter.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the girls joined the young
Mackays on a cool upper porch of the hotel,
where they were able to be by themselves. It
was then that Linda told her story, first extracting
a promise from the group never to
mention the kidnapping episode to anyone else,
lest the news get back to her Aunt Emily. The
other girls listened in amazement, now and then
interrupting with exclamations of horror at the
outrage of it all. Ted sat grimly silent, more
angry than anyone.</p>

<p>"And if you hadn't escaped, we probably
shouldn't have gotten there in time," observed
Louise. "To rescue you, I mean. Because of
course they meant to kill you in the end."</p>

<p>"Did you realize that at the time?" asked
Dot.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Linda. "Though I
really feared something much worse. I thought
they would imprison me on that island in the
ocean, and let me die of starvation. And I was
horribly afraid of those men. I tried to keep
with Susie until they went away."</p>

<p>"It was that bank robbery that saved your
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
life," remarked Louise. "And spelled ruin for
them. If they hadn't been so greedy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" exclaimed Linda. "That's one
reason why I feel it's my solemn duty to try to
catch the fourth man, and get that money back.
I'm really the only person who could identify
him&mdash;except Susie."</p>

<p>"Do you honestly think she'll reform?"
asked Dot.</p>

<p>"I hope so. If those new parts for the autogiro
really come tomorrow, we'll fly over and
get her, Dot."</p>

<p>"I'm crazy to see her," returned the latter.
"And I'd enjoy going to the jail to see those
two prisoners, and gloat over their punishment!"</p>

<p>"Dot's as vindictive as I am!" joked Louise.
"Remember all the dark futures I used to wish
for Bess Hulbert?"</p>

<p>"Poor Bess!" sighed Linda. "She certainly
got hers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thinking that the girls had heard enough of
Linda's unpleasant experiences, Ted interrupted
them by suggesting that they all go
somewhere and have something to eat.</p>

<p>"If it's cool, I'm for it," agreed Louise,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
jumping up and putting her hand through her
husband's arm.</p>

<p>"You're not too tired, are you, Linda?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" protested the girl. "I feel like
a new person since you three arrived....
There's a lovely screened tea-garden across the
street that looks awfully attractive. Shall we
go there?"</p>

<p>Linda was right in her impression; the place
was charming. Instead of the customary artificial
flowers or tiny bouquets so often seen in
restaurants, real rose-bushes showered their
profusion of fragrance all about the edges of
the screen garden. Surprisingly, every one was
hungry; the three visitors because they had
eaten only a light picnic supper, Linda because
she had been too homesick to eat much alone.
The food proved as delightful as the surroundings,
and they all enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>While Dot was, eating her ice, she noticed
some people that she seemed to remember&mdash;sitting
at a table in back of Linda. But she
could not place them.</p>

<p>"Linda," she said softly, "see that young
man over there at that table back of you&mdash;to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the right&mdash;with an older woman? Don't turn
around now, he's staring at us.... He looks
sort of familiar to me, and I'm positive I've seen
that woman before. Do you know them, or are
they people I have met at Palm Beach sometime,
one of those winters when we went to
Florida?"</p>

<p>Linda waited a moment, and then casually
turned her head in the direction which Dot had
indicated. The boy was Jackson Carter!</p>

<p>In relating her story of the rescue by the two
boys in the canoe, Linda had not even mentioned
their names, and had omitted entirely
her visit to the Carter home. After her telephone
conversation with Jackson this evening,
she had decided to forget all about him.</p>

<p>She noticed that Dot was smiling and nodding.</p>

<p>"I remember her now," she explained. "A
Mrs. Carter&mdash;she chummed a lot with mother
at Palm Beach. And that's her son&mdash;he wasn't
more than fourteen the last time I saw him....
I think I'll go over and speak to them."
Linda flushed and tried to hide her embarrassment
by talking to Louise and Ted about their
flight. But Dot came back in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got an invitation for us, Linda!" she
announced. "Finish your lemon ice, and come
over and meet the Carters. All of you!"</p>

<p>Linda hesitated. She did not know what to
say. Evidently Jackson had not recognized her,
or else was deliberately concealing the fact that
he knew her.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Louise, rising and pulling
Ted by the hand, for her youthful husband
was still shy about meeting the people whom
he termed the "four hundred." But his manners
were as good as anyone's, and Louise was
always proud of him.</p>

<p>They stepped over to the table, Linda reluctantly
following them.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carter, I want you to meet Mrs.
Mackay&mdash;our chaperon." Dot winked slyly at
Louise. "And Miss Linda Carlton, the famous
aviatrix! And Mr. Mackay.... And this is
Mr. Carter."</p>

<p>The young people bowed in recognition of the
introduction, but Jackson gave no sign that he
had ever seen Linda before.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carter says that so long as our chaperon
is leaving tomorrow, we must come over
and stay at her house, Linda," Dot said. "You
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
see, Mrs. Carter," she continued, turning to
the older woman, "we're not so strict in the
North about chaperons as you are here&mdash;but
Linda's aunt would like to be. It really worries
her to have her niece batting around alone in an
airplane."</p>

<p>Horribly embarrassed, her eyelids fluttering
so that she could not see anybody distinctly,
Linda tried to summon words to decline the
invitation. It would be impossible for her to
accept.</p>

<p>"We'd love to have you, girls," Mrs. Carter
assured them. "For as long as you can stay....
How I would enjoy seeing your mother,
Dorothy! You must tell me all about her."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," stammered Linda, still
avoiding Jackson's eyes, "but I'm afraid we
can't possibly make it. The fact is, I am expecting
to get my autogiro tomorrow, and that
will take us away from Jacksonville."</p>

<p>"Bring it out to our place!" urged the young
man, with the deepest pleading in his tone. It
was the first time that he had spoken, and
everybody was surprised at his eagerness. That
is, everybody except Linda&mdash;who had heard the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
same pleading over the telephone a few hours
before.</p>

<p>His mother smiled approvingly. She was glad
to see that her son was interested in Dorothy
Crowley, for the Crowleys were wealthy people,
of unquestionable social position.</p>

<p>But, had she known it, Jackson did not even
see Dot. He was lost in admiration of Linda&mdash;or
Ann, as he thought of her. In her pale chiffon
dress she looked absolutely ravishing. How
could he ever have doubted that she was of
good family?</p>

<p>"No, thank you ever so much, but we can't
possibly," Linda repeated. "We&mdash;or rather I&mdash;have
work to do. Of course if Dot wants to
go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at the other girl fearfully. How
she would hate to lose her!</p>

<p>Dot's reply, however, was reassuring.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Carter, I must stick with Linda.
It isn't often that my mother gives in and lets
me go off like this, and I mean to take advantage
of it Besides, there's adventure ahead!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter sighed; these modern girls were
beyond her comprehension. She was thankful
that her only child was a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>While Dot was saying good-by, explaining
that the Mackays had to be up early in the
morning, Jackson managed a whisper to Linda.</p>

<p>"When can I see you, Ann? I just <i>must</i>!"</p>

<p>Linda smiled; she was in command of herself
again. She had won in a difficult situation.</p>

<p>"Some time when we both winter at Palm
Beach or Miami," she replied, lightly, as she
nodded good-by to his mother.</p>

<p>The young man's interest in Linda had not
escaped Dot's notice. When they had left the
restaurant, she remarked, teasingly:</p>

<p>"You certainly made a hit, my dear. But I'm
just as glad you turned down their invitation.
The Carters have a marvelous home, I believe,
but they're about 1890 vintage. They don't
know that there was a War."</p>

<p>"Well, we really haven't any time to lose,"
was her companion's reply. "I'm almost afraid
now that Susie will be gone when we get to that
island. And I'm in a hurry to help the police
trace that other thief with the money."</p>

<p>"Adventure is right!" laughed Dot, as the
girls said good-by to Ted and Louise, and went
to their room.</p>

<p>The Mackays left soon after dawn the following
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
morning, but Linda and Dot had decided to
have a good sleep. They did not waken until
after ten o'clock, when they heard the telephone
ringing in their ears.</p>

<p>It was Dot who answered it.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Jackson!" she said, with a wink
at Linda. "I used to call you by your first name,
so I suppose I might as well now. How's everything?"</p>

<p>"Just fine," replied the young man. "And
Dot&mdash;may I speak to Miss Carlton?"</p>

<p>"O.K.," answered the girl, holding the telephone
towards Linda.</p>

<p>"Not awake yet!" yawned Linda, burying
her head in the pillow.</p>

<p>"She says she's not awake yet," explained
Dot, laughingly. "Better call later, Jackson&mdash;after
we get some breakfast."</p>

<p>Replacing the telephone, she turned to her
roommate.</p>

<p>"That big boy certainly fell for you, Linda!"
she exclaimed, still unaware of the fact that
Jackson had not met her for just the first time.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't fall for him," the other
stated, firmly. "And Dot, please, from now on
I'm not at home when he calls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Dot was surprised at this announcement; it
was unlike Linda not to be friendly to everybody.
Why had she taken such a dislike to a
young man as handsome as Jackson Carter?</p>

<p>"May I ask you a personal question, Linda?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"Why certainly, Dot!"</p>

<p>"Are you engaged to Ralph Clavering&mdash;and
is that why you're turning other men away?"</p>

<p>Linda laughed at the idea.</p>

<p>"No, Dot&mdash;I'm not engaged to anybody. And
I don't want to be. I want to be free for a while.
But not from my girl-friends!" she added
hastily, reaching over and giving Dot a hug.
"Oh, Dot, if I could ever tell you what it meant
to me to have you three breeze in last night!
Honestly, I was awfully low."</p>

<p>"It was Lou's idea," explained Dot. "I guess
she thought you would be&mdash;so far away from
everybody&mdash;even if you hadn't been in any difficulty."</p>

<p>"Lou's a peach," observed Linda.</p>

<p>They ordered a tray sent up to their room,
and lingered lazily over their breakfast. Before
they had finished the telephone rang again. This
time it was the Jacksonville Airport, informing
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Linda that the new parts for her autogiro
had arrived.</p>

<p>"I'll have to hurry!" she said to Dot. "I
don't want to lose a minute now."</p>

<p>"Just what are your plans, Linda?" asked
the other girl, as she, too, started to dress.</p>

<p>"Go to the airport and have the parts for
the Ladybug put into a plane. Then fly to Soldiers'
Camp Island, taking another mechanic
along. I'll help this man fix the autogiro&mdash;collect
Susie&mdash;and fly back here."</p>

<p>"You really believe you can fix it in one
day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Why not!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Dot slowly, "I think if you
don't mind, I'll stay here. You'll need all the
space you can get in your plane to carry those
parts to the wreck. And I'd be fearfully bored
standing around while you work."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," agreed Linda. "It
would be better for me to take two men&mdash;a pilot
and a mechanic. Because I can't fly this hired
plane back again&mdash;I'll have to pilot the Ladybug."</p>

<p>"And you have to bring Susie too," Dot reminded
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Linda lost no time in getting ready, and she
was pleased to have left the hotel before Jackson
Carter had a chance to telephone again.
She found a "repair" plane waiting for her
at the airport, and she made note of the new
parts for the autogiro that were already packed
into it. Two men were prepared to go with her&mdash;one
a pilot, the other a mechanic. For once in
her life Linda was to ride as a passenger.</p>

<p>The day was hot and dry, but over the swamp
the air seemed cooler and fresher. The rainy
season was late, everybody said; by this time of
year the swamp was usually flooded.</p>

<p>As the plane flew over the desolate expanse,
Linda smiled to herself at the familiarity of
the landscape. She was getting to be an authority
on the Okefenokee Swamp; she never need
fear again being lost in its southern part, at
least. Although the pilot had a reliable map,
he found Linda's directions helpful, and before
noon they came down on Soldiers' Camp Island.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck their notice was
the autogiro, still leaning over on its side, looking
pathetically helpless in its plight. But Susie
was not in sight.</p>

<p>While the men unloaded their tools and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
new parts for the damaged plane, Linda went
in search of the girl she had left there two days
before. It was queer, she thought, that Susie
had not come out to meet them at the sound of
their motor. Was it possible that she was sick&mdash;or
only asleep?</p>

<p>The island was a comparatively large one,
several miles in length, and Linda decided immediately
to explore it. Susie might be waiting
somewhere within its depths, helpless or hurt,
if she had fallen on her injured ankle. It would
be necessary to make a thorough search.</p>

<p>Linda ran back to the autogiro to inquire
whether the men needed her help, and explained
what she was about to do.</p>

<p>"We don't need you yet, Miss," replied the
mechanic. "Later on, when she's almost finished,
you can help me look her over, and take
her up for a test."</p>

<p>"By the way, Miss Carlton," put in the pilot,
"did you think to bring any food for lunch?
I only brought water."</p>

<p>Linda shook her head regretfully. How could
she have been so stupid? Had her excitement
over regaining her autogiro destroyed all her
common sense?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," she said. "I just plain
forgot! And I usually have some in the autogiro,
but those thieves took it out.... Wait,
though! There may be some on the island. We
left a half a dozen cans with this girl."</p>

<p>A search of the little "houses" farther in
on the island revealed what she had been hoping
for&mdash;the remainder of the supplies the boys
had left with Susie, consisting of two cans of
baked beans, tea, coffee, sugar and canned milk.
This ought to be enough for their lunch, and
she ran back immediately to the men with the
good news.</p>

<p>For the next two hours Linda searched the
island diligently, calling Susie by name at frequent
intervals. But no answer came in reply,
and she found no trace of the girl. Susie had
completely vanished.</p>

<p>Weary and hungry she returned to the shore
of the island where the men were working, and
was delighted at the progress they had made.
The job was almost finished.</p>

<p>"I can't find the girl," she told them. "But
I've collected enough fire-wood to cook our
coffee and beans. We'll have our lunch in a little
while."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Two hours later the autogiro was finished,
ready for its flight back to Jacksonville. The
engine was running smoothly; Linda climbed
into the cock-pit and took it up in the air for a
test flight. She found everything satisfactory;
dipping low, she gave the others the signal to
leave. With her Ladybug in the lead, the two
planes made record time back to Jacksonville.</p>

<p>"She's as good as new," she told the mechanic
joyfully, after both planes had landed,
and she was paying her bill. "I wish I could fly
her right over to my hotel."</p>

<p>"I believe you almost could," remarked the
man, admiringly. "Land her at the front entrance,
like a taxi-cab!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll have to take an ordinary
cab," sighed Linda, spotting one out near the
gate. "Thanks a lot&mdash;and good-by! I'm in a
hurry to be back."</p>

<p>It was after six when Linda ascended the
steps of her hotel, and found Dot waiting for
her on the porch, trying in vain to keep cool.</p>

<p>"Where's Susie?" she demanded, immediately.</p>

<p>"Gone!" replied Linda. "I searched the
whole island carefully&mdash;but not a sign of her!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where could she go?" demanded Dot. "Do
you 'spose some canoe picked her up&mdash;maybe
those same boys that rescued you?"</p>

<p>Linda shook her head. Not those boys, any
way! "What I'm afraid of is that the fourth
man of the gang&mdash;the only one who escaped,
you know&mdash;picked her up in his boat."</p>

<p>"Not so good&mdash;not so good," muttered her
companion.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. Just when I thought Susie had
reformed, too&mdash;and cut free from those criminals!"
Linda uttered a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, let's forget her," suggested the other
girl, cheerfully. "I've been waiting all afternoon
to take you for a swim&mdash;so let's go, and
have our dinner later. I understand there's a
marvelous pool a couple of blocks away."</p>

<p>Linda's face brightened. What could possibly
be better on such a hot day!</p>

<p>"Let's go!" she exclaimed. "Lead me to it."</p>

<p>After her disappointment at losing Susie, and
her strenuous day in the heat, the relaxation
of swimming in the lovely out-door pool was
exactly what Linda needed. The water was cool
and refreshing, and the surroundings charming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>For half an hour Linda swam lazily about,
resting now and then on her back, occasionally
mounting the board for a dive. At last she felt
that she had had enough, and seated herself
on the edge of the pool, dangling her feet in
the water, and watching Dot perform all sorts
of fancy dives, for the other girl was a real
champion.</p>

<p>"What a marvelous girl Dot is," Linda was
thinking, when she was suddenly startled by the
sound of a masculine voice, almost in her very
ear.</p>

<p>"Ann! Think of finding you here!"</p>

<p>Linda squirmed a little, thinking that the man
must have made a mistake in thinking she was
some other girl. For the time being, she forgot
all about her middle name.</p>

<p>"Miss Carlton," insisted the voice.</p>

<p>Turning about, she saw Jackson behind her,</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said, coolly.</p>

<p>The young man became embarrassed at her
manner. He did not know what to say.</p>

<p>"Miss Crowley is a marvelous diver," he
muttered, though it wasn't that that he wanted
to talk about.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," agreed Linda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a silence. The girl made no effort
to be entertaining.</p>

<p>"You really are the girl who flew across the
ocean alone, and won that big prize?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Yes." Linda made a half-hearted gesture to
repress a yawn. Jackson Carter needn't think
he could buy her favor by flattery!</p>

<p>"But why didn't you tell Hal and me that,
when we found you in the swamp?"</p>

<p>"It had no particular bearing on the subject,
that I could see."</p>

<p>"If my mother had known that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If your mother didn't wish to receive me
at her home," interrupted Linda, "there was
no reason in the world why she should. Everyone
has a right to her own opinion!"</p>

<p>"But now that we've been formally introduced,
it's different," he urged. "Please tell me
how long you'll be in Jacksonville."</p>

<p class="pmb3">"We're leaving tomorrow," she said, rising.
"And will you please excuse me&mdash;as I see Dot
going to the dressing-room?"</p>

<i>The Island in the Ocean</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>"I certainly am sorry we don't have Susie
with us," remarked Dot, as the girls sat down to
their late dinner that evening, after their refreshing
swim. "I thought she'd be better than
a 'talkie' for amusement."</p>

<p>"Yes, you would have enjoyed her, Dot,"
agreed Linda, picking up the menu and studying
it with a great deal of interest. "I'm going
to order everything here, Dot. I'm simply
starved."</p>

<p>"So am I, though I ought to be ashamed to
admit it. You should have seen the lunch I ate!"</p>

<p>"And you should have seen my lunch!" returned
Linda. "We forgot to carry anything,
but fortunately Susie had left beans and coffee
on the island."</p>

<p>"Is that all you had?"</p>

<p>Linda nodded, and gave her order to the
waiter.</p>

<p>"I'd certainly like to know where Susie is
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
now," she remarked, after she had satisfied the
sharpest pangs of hunger with an iced fruit-cup.</p>

<p>"Yes, so would I," agreed Dot. "Her disappearance
will make it a lot harder to trace
that other thief.... Do you really expect to
do anything about hunting him, Linda?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do! Tomorrow's only the twenty-seventh,
and I don't have to report to Atlanta
until July first. I'm going to use those four
days."</p>

<p>"But what could you possibly do?" inquired
Dot. "How would you know where to go&mdash;without
even a suggestion from Susie?"</p>

<p>"I have a theory," explained the other girl.
"Wait till I eat some of this beef-steak, and
I'll tell you about it."</p>

<p>"I'm crazy to hear it, because I'll be with
you all the time. Mother said I must start back
home the first of July&mdash;the day you go to Atlanta.
I have my ticket bought."</p>

<p>For a few moments Linda ate her dinner in silence,
enjoying every mouthful as only a hungry
person can. Then, lowering her voice so that
there was no danger of being overheard, she
told her chum her plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've thought it all out," she began. "This
is what must have happened: That thief&mdash;the
'Doc,' as the gang called him&mdash;took the boat
and the money the day after the bank robbery,
when he woke up and found that Susie and her
husband had flown away in the autogiro, and
the other two were still asleep. His idea was
to get out of the swamp to the St. Mary's or
some other river, that would take him to the
ocean."</p>

<p>"And get on a steamer?" demanded Dot.
"But Linda, if he did that, he's out of the
country by now."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that. A canoe trip like
that would take a good while&mdash;the Okefenokee is
fifty miles at least from the coast. And he'd be
afraid to take a train&mdash;or an automobile, for
fear of being seen. Besides, I don't think he'd
take a steamer right away. He'd want to go
to that island first."</p>

<p>"In his canoe?" inquired the other, skeptically.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. He'd hire a motor-boat&mdash;or
steal one."</p>

<p>"I still don't understand why he'd want to
get to that island," remarked Dot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"For two reasons," explained Linda. "One
because he expected to pick up those jewels&mdash;which
we have already taken away&mdash;and the
other reason is that the gang has arrangements
with some party that owns a steamer, to stop
at the island on certain specified dates. That
would be his way of getting out of the country."</p>

<p>"It does sound plausible," admitted Dot.
"What a brain you have, Linda!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of that, Dot! It's only that I've
been so closely associated with these criminals
that I'm beginning to see their motives."</p>

<p>"And where does Susie come into all this?"</p>

<p>"The man must have seen her on Soldiers'
Camp Island, from his canoe. Or rather, he saw
the wrecked autogiro, and knew she must be
there."</p>

<p>"And forced her to go with him?"</p>

<p>"Probably. He didn't want to take any
chances, leaving her free to help the police."</p>

<p>Linda paused for a moment to eat the salad
with which she had been served, and glanced
about the dining-room. No one seemed to know
her, or notice her&mdash;for that she was sincerely
thankful.</p>

<p>It was not until they had finished their dinner
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and found a cool, secluded spot on the veranda,
that she went on with her plan.</p>

<p>"What I mean to do," she said quietly, "is to
fly back to the camp on Black Jack Island early
tomorrow. Not that I expect to find anyone
there&mdash;but merely to get my direction&mdash;to go
on to that island in the ocean. I don't know its
name, so I couldn't look it up on the map."</p>

<p>"You really expect to catch those two on
that island?" asked Dot, excitedly. "Will you
take the police along?"</p>

<p>"No! I don't want to tell them a word about
all this, except to say that I am going scouting
about the country, and to ask for a couple of
revolvers.... And, in answer to your first
question, I don't really expect to find Susie and
the 'Doc' there yet. But I believe they'll be
along soon."</p>

<p>"And we wait for them there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Take them unawares. Susie will probably
be on our side, and we can plan something
with her.... Of course this is all only theory.
Maybe there isn't a thing in it. That gang was
slick; they seemed to know how to drop right
off the face of the earth. And I believe this man
may be the cleverest of them all. He was quiet;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
it's the boasting kind, like Susie's husband, who
usually get caught first.... So you can see
why I don't want any of the police along."</p>

<p>"We better take plenty of food, though," remarked
Dot.</p>

<p>"We will take some&mdash;but don't forget that we
can easily fly back to the coast each night. The
island is only a few miles out&mdash;it's nothing in
a plane."</p>

<p>"True," admitted the other.</p>

<p>"And we'll keep our room here at the hotel,
for we want some place as headquarters. We'll
put a few over-night necessities into my bag."</p>

<p>"O.K. I'll order a roast chicken and a chocolate
cake from the dining-room tonight."</p>

<p>"Oranges, too," added Linda. "They always
taste so good. I mustn't forget to fill my
thermos-bottles, either."</p>

<p>They went to bed early that night, in order
to get a good start on the following morning.
Dot, who was particularly enthusiastic about
the chocolate cake, carried the basket of food,
while Linda took the handbag. They arrived at
the City Hall immediately after breakfast, and
were ushered right into Captain Magee's office.</p>

<p>"No news of the fourth man yet," he said,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
after he had greeted Linda and been introduced
to Dot. "But I've sent out a call for him by
radio, so that all ships are to be warned to be
on the look-out for a fellow of his description."</p>

<p>"There's something else I want to tell you,"
added Linda, "that may help to spot him.
There is probably a girl with him." Then,
rather reluctantly, she told what she knew of
Susie, begging the Captain not to punish her
too severely if she were found.</p>

<p>"And now," she concluded, "Miss Crowley
and I want to do a little scouting ourselves&mdash;in
the autogiro&mdash;and I want to know whether
you will lend us a couple of .38s for the undertaking."</p>

<p>The Captain smiled whimsically. What an
unusual girl Linda Carlton was! No wonder
she had done things no other girl had even
tried.</p>

<p>"Of course I will," he said. "Though such a
request is rather out of the ordinary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is an extraordinary occasion," remarked
Linda.</p>

<p>"Don't you want a detective to go with you?"
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thank you, we haven't room in the
autogiro. Besides, we don't want to waste his
time&mdash;for it may be only a wild goose chase.
But if you will lend us a couple of revolvers, I
think we shall be safe."</p>

<p>"Can you shoot?"</p>

<p>"If it is necessary. But I don't think it will
be. The girl got to be very friendly with me,
after her husband was killed. If I had only gotten
to her in time, I think I could have saved
her. As it is, she may not have joined the man
of her own free will. You see she had been hurt,
and was partially helpless. So he could do most
anything he liked with her, if he had her alone."</p>

<p>"Well, good luck to you!" said the Captain.
"I certainly take off my hat to a plucky pair of
girls."</p>

<p>When Linda and Dot arrived at the airport
they found the Ladybug in readiness for its
second flight into the swamp. Linda inspected
her, and piled in the equipment.</p>

<p>"I feel as if the Okefenokee Swamp were my
home," she remarked, as she headed the autogiro
in that direction. "I could almost fly it
blind!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't!" warned Dot. "Your friend the Doc
is still at large, and he may be watching for
us with a gun."</p>

<p>This was Dot's first view of the swamp, and
as they approached it, she was amazed at the
vast expanse of it, stretching out in every direction.</p>

<p>"It's huge, isn't it?" she shouted to Linda,
through the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>"Forty miles long and thirty wide," was the
reply. "But we see only the southern end of
it."</p>

<p>Conversation was difficult, so the girls gave
it up until they came to Black Jack Island,
where Linda had been held a prisoner.</p>

<p>"Shall we get out?" she asked her companion.
"Or go straight on to the ocean?"</p>

<p>"Let's get out," replied Dot. "They might
possibly be here, you know. Besides, I'm crazy
to see their camp."</p>

<p>Linda brought the autogiro to earth and the
girls climbed out cautiously, their revolvers in
readiness, lest the enemy appear. But there was
no human sound&mdash;nothing but the birds and the
insects.</p>

<p>"Watch out for snakes, Dot!" warned Linda.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
"I'd almost rather meet the Doc than a snake,
I believe."</p>

<p>They walked carefully towards the camp only
to find it absolutely deserted.</p>

<p>"Let's look all around," suggested Linda,
who remembered everything only too well.
"We'll begin with the mess-tent."</p>

<p>Quietly at first, they snooped around, peering
into boxes of provisions, looking under the
cots, behind the tents, and, when they were quite
sure that they were alone, they began to act
more natural, to laugh and joke with each other.</p>

<p>Linda showed Dot the tent which she had
shared with Susie that one night of her captivity,
and they both smiled over the sight of
the magazine which had led to Linda's escape.</p>

<p>"We could even stay here all night if we had
to," Dot remarked. "Seems comfortable
enough."</p>

<p>Linda shuddered.</p>

<p>"Never again!" she protested. "But we may
as well eat some lunch before we fly to that
island. I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"And thirsty. But it isn't so hot here as it
was in Jacksonville."</p>

<p>"No. And the island out in the ocean ought
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
to be cooler yet. You may like it so well that
you'll want to spend the summer there. Only
it has no tents or cots, like this camp."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'd rather not play Robinson
Crusoe," replied Dot.</p>

<p>"Poor man!" sighed Linda. "If he'd only
had an airplane, how simple it would have
been for him."</p>

<p>They ate their lunch, and then, for the third
time, Linda flew across the Okefenokee and over
the coastal plain of Georgia&mdash;out to the barren
island in the ocean where the treasure had been
hidden. The desolate loneliness of the spot impressed
her companion.</p>

<p>"You suggested this as a summer resort!"
she remarked, when they had landed. "Why, I
don't even see a fishing-boat!"</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble," replied Linda.
"The first time I flew here&mdash;with Susie's husband&mdash;I
looked about desperately for somebody
to shout to for help. And there wasn't a
soul! Nothing but ocean and sky.... Do you
have your revolver handy, Dot?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Right here. But I don't know much
about shooting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure we shan't have to. I just want to
explore. But 'be prepared' is our motto."</p>

<p>"I will be. I won't shoot you, either, Linda&mdash;you
can count on me for that."</p>

<p>Climbing out of the autogiro they walked towards
the center of the island where the sand
was soft and the underbrush thick. Perhaps,
thought Linda, there might be more hiding
places than the one hole which she knew; it
would be worth while to make a thorough
search. On and on they plodded, the sand sinking
into their shoes, the sun beating down upon
them with full blast, for what trees there were,
were not high enough to afford much shade. It
was difficult to find the hiding place in such
monotonous desolation, but at last she came to
the spot.</p>

<p>"Somebody's been here since I came with the
police!" she said to Dot, "because we left the
stones as we found them. But it looks as if the
hole is empty."</p>

<p>She was correct in her surmise. After five
minutes of pushing the sand away, Linda had
assured herself that nothing was there.</p>

<p>"Let's go down to the opposite shore from
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the one we came in on," suggested Dot. "And
explore that."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Linda. "If you can stand
walking through this sand again...." She
stopped abruptly, peering towards the shore.
An instant later she dragged the other girl to
the ground. "The Doc!" she whispered,
hoarsely. "I saw him down by the water&mdash;maybe
there's a boat coming!"</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" demanded Dot, clutching
her revolver tightly.</p>

<p>"Wait till he gets on&mdash;and follow in the autogiro.
I've got plenty of gas.... Let's be creeping
back to the Ladybug."</p>

<p>The girls kept well hidden behind the underbrush,
crawling along on their hands and knees.
Suddenly Dot stopped; she had struck something
solid. A canvas bag&mdash;two bags, stuffed
full with something. Could it be the money?</p>

<p>Breathless, they both stopped while Linda untwisted
with her pen-knife the coarse pieces of
wire around the tops of the bags, and dumped
out the contents. Money in an amount they had
never seen before! Hundred dollar bills in rolls
that they had no time to count, bonds in thousand-dollar
denominations!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">"Hide it quickly, Dot!" whispered Linda. "In
your pockets, your riding-breeches&mdash;stuff some
of it in my clothes&mdash;while I re-fill these bags
with sand.... And have your revolver
ready."</p>

<i>The Money-Bags</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Linda's theories regarding the fourth member
of the gang of thieves had been only partially
correct. As she had surmised, the "Doc"
slipped off in the canoe from Black Jack Island
while his companions slept, and he did stop at
Soldiers' Camp. But it was not he who compelled
Susie to go with him, but the girl herself
who insisted upon accompanying him.</p>

<p>Susie's desire to reform had been sincere
while Linda was with her. She had actually
meant to cut free from the gang and go back to
a normal mode of life&mdash;earning her living as she
had done when she met her husband. No more
sneaking about in fear of the law, no more hiding
in that desolate camp in the Okefenokee
Swamp! She would get a job at an airport, and
take up flying again. She might even become
famous&mdash;like Linda Carlton!</p>

<p>But unfortunately, after the famous aviatrix
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
left her alone, her enthusiasm faded, and her
faith in her ability to make a "come-back"
died as suddenly as it was born. How could she
ever hope to be free from the stain of her last
two years of living&mdash;since her marriage to
"Slats"? If Linda did not turn her over to
the police authorities, someone else would.
She might have to serve five or ten years in
prison.</p>

<p>As the afternoon passed, she grew more and
more miserable, more anxious to get away. If
only she had a boat! If her ankle were not so
painful, and her bandaged head not so conspicuous!
If there were only some way for her to
escape!</p>

<p>Having no appetite, she made no pretense
at preparing any supper for herself. There was
still some cold tea left from lunch; she decided
to make that her meal, and an hour later she
fell asleep where she was, right on the shore of
the island.</p>

<p>The sun was rising over the swamp when she
awakened the following morning, and she sat up
with difficulty, cramped by her uncomfortable
position in sleep.</p>

<p>"I might as well be dead&mdash;with Slats," she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
thought, morbidly, as she viewed the desolation
around her. Again she tried to rise, when the
soft sound of a paddle, dipping into the quiet
water attracted her attention. She waited
breathlessly. Were the boys coming back so
soon?</p>

<p>Not long afterward a canoe came into sight.
Susie's heart leaped with joy when she recognized
who was guiding it. The Doc!</p>

<p>"Doc!" she cried. "Bill Rickers!" she added,
using the man's real name. "It's Susie!"</p>

<p>The man pulled up to the island, amazed at
finding her there. In the dawning light he saw
the autogiro, lying half on its side.</p>

<p>"Where's Slats?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Dead," answered the girl, immediately.
"We had a wreck.... Will you take me with
you?" she begged. "I'm almost crazy here all
by myself."</p>

<p>"I wanted to make a get-away alone," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"You have the money!" she cried, jumping
at once to the correct conclusion. "Where are
the other two men?"</p>

<p>"Asleep at Black Jack Island."</p>

<p>"And where are you going?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Out of the swamp&mdash;across the state, and
then over to our island. The yacht's due there
tomorrow&mdash;I want to be ready to go with it."</p>

<p>"O.K. with me," agreed Susie, as if she had
been invited to go. "Let's push off now&mdash;or
wait&mdash;we'll eat some breakfast. There's beans
and cold tea."</p>

<p>"Maybe you could be some use," remarked
the man, as he ate the meager breakfast. "If
we could get a plane. And I am sorry for you,
Kid&mdash;all alone here with Slats dead."</p>

<p>Susie gave him no chance to change his mind.
Hobbling out to the little "house" where the
boys had put the blanket and the extra food,
she picked up the former, smoothed her dress
and her hair, and returned to announce herself
ready. They pushed off again, following the
little stream out of the swamp.</p>

<p>"How do you expect to get across the state?"
asked the girl, wearily, when late that afternoon,
they brought their canoe to a landing. She
had slept a little in the boat, but she was still
very tired.</p>

<p>"Hitch-hike, I reckon," was the reply. "If
we go hirin' any cars, somebody might get suspicious.
Once at the coast, I count on rentin' a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
little fishing-boat from some fellow&mdash;one big
enough to take us to the island."</p>

<p>"I can't hitch-hike," objected Susie.</p>

<p>"Don't then,&mdash;stay here," answered the
man, indifferently.</p>

<p>"You know I can't do that, either. Let's go
to that house over there, and see if we can't
get some supper. Maybe they have an old Ford
or a team of horses."</p>

<p>"You foot the bill?" he asked, shrewdly.
With all that money in his possession, this man
had no intention of spending any of it on anyone
but himself.</p>

<p>Susie considered a moment. She hadn't any
money at all&mdash;she always got what she wanted
from her husband. But she owned some costly
jewelry.</p>

<p>"I'll give you this diamond," she offered,
"if you get me safe out of the country. And no
walkin'!"</p>

<p>"O.K.," he muttered, his greedy eyes gleaming
at the sight of the beautiful jewel. "You
win. Go ask the woman yourself."</p>

<p>It was thus, by strange coincidence, that Susie
and the Doc rode across Georgia that evening in
the same Ford that had driven Linda and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
boys to Jacksonville the night before. They
reached a seaport town a little after midnight,
and Susie succeeded in finding a house to stay
in, though her companion preferred to remain
out-doors, for he said he "didn't trust nobody."
In the morning, when she joined him, he had
rented an old motor-boat from a fisherman.
"Rent" was the word he used, but he had not
the slightest intention of returning it.</p>

<p>"You can run her, Susie," he said. "You're
better at engines than I am, and she'll need
coaxing. I'll steer."</p>

<p>It was a difficult cruise, for at times the engine
coughed and died, and Susie had to try all
sorts of methods to start her up again. When
they finally came within sight of the island,
the motor sputtered its last and refused to function
any longer. The man managed to get the
boat inshore by riding the waves, and using the
oars kept at the bottom of the boat for just such
an emergency.</p>

<p>About the time Linda Carlton and Dot Crowley
were eating their lunch on Black Jack
Island, Susie and the Doc were making their
landing. They pulled in at the opposite shore
from the one which the girls later used in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
autogiro. The man's first concern was with the
hiding-place where he expected to find the boxes
of jewels. His disappointment was keen when
he discovered that they had been taken away.</p>

<p>"The cops has found us out!" he snarled
angrily at Susie, as if it were her fault.
"They'll be back again&mdash;I'll bet you! We gotta
get out of here!"</p>

<p>"How?" demanded Susie. "Not in that
boat?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Maybe the yacht will be along early,
but it ain't likely. It usually runs after dark."</p>

<p>Dumping his bags in the sand not far from
the hole, he tried to think what would be best
to do.</p>

<p>"We gotta act quick, Susie&mdash;if the cops come.
No use tryin' to put up a fight&mdash;with only one
gun, and them two bags to guard.... You
watch on that other shore, and I'll go back to
the one we came in on. Whatever they come in&mdash;airplane
or boat&mdash;we gotta swipe. Hide if you
see anything comin', give 'em a chance to get
into the island&mdash;and grab their boat. Give me
a signal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How?" she interrupted.</p>

<p>"You take the gun, and shoot when you're
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
ready to push off.... If I see anybody on my
side, I'll whistle, as near like a bird as I can."
He grinned to himself; if the police came in
anything but an airplane, he wouldn't bother
with Susie. Let her face the music!</p>

<p>"O.K. But I couldn't run, Doc. Don't forget
that."</p>

<p>"I ain't forgettin'," he returned.</p>

<p>They separated, and for two hours waited
tensely, keeping a sharp look-out for the rescuing
yacht, hoping against hope that it would
arrive before the police. But at three o'clock
their worst fears were realized. Susie saw the
autogiro coming towards them, and hobbled off
into the depths of the island to conceal herself.
Lying flat on the sand, she was not able to
identify the people who got out of the plane, but
she could see that they both wore riding-breeches,
and she believed they were men. So
she kept still until they had disappeared into the
underbrush. Then she began to creep laboriously,
in a round-about fashion, to the autogiro.</p>

<p>Susie's progress was slow; she did not reach
the plane until after Linda and Dot had succeeded
in emptying the bags of the money, and
refilled them with sand. The girls had just
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
recognized the man on the shore, and were
creeping farther into the island, out of sight
of him, when the shot of the pistol rang out
above the roar of the ocean. They had no way
of knowing that Susie had fired it.</p>

<p>A moment later they heard the rustle and
crackle of underbrush, as the man came towards
them. From her hiding place, now some distance
from the bags, Linda raised her head cautiously,
and saw the thief retrieve the bags with
a grab. Then he dashed back to the shore, circled
the island on the harder sand, and reached the
opposite shore, where the autogiro was standing.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he come after us?" whispered
Linda, in amazement.</p>

<p>"He will soon, I'm afraid," replied Dot
hoarsely, clutching her revolver tightly. "But
I'm going to shoot if he does!"</p>

<p>"So am I," answered Linda, calmly. "We've
got the advantage&mdash;we're hidden."</p>

<p>Tensely they waited for five minutes&mdash;possibly
ten; then something they had not thought
of happened. The engine of the autogiro began
to roar!</p>

<p>"They're stealing the Ladybug!" cried
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Linda, aghast at such a calamity. "Susie must
be with him! Dot, we can't let them do that!"</p>

<p>Regardless of the danger, Linda jumped up
excitedly, and rushed to a clearing, where she
had a view of the shore. She was just in time
to see her beloved autogiro taxi along the beach
and rise into the air.</p>

<p>Dot dashed to her side, and the two girls
stood together in helpless agony of spirit.</p>

<p>"Prisoners!" cried Dot, at last, dropping her
useless revolver into the sand.</p>

<p>"Robinson Crusoes!" added Linda, bitterly.
"No better off! No plane!"</p>

<p class="pmb3">"With thousands of dollars!" groaned her
companion, ironically. "Where money is no
good at all!"</p>

<i>The Broken Motor-Boat</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>The two girls continued to stand perfectly
still on the sand, gazing at the retreating autogiro,
which apparently was flying out farther
over the ocean, and circling about in a strange
manner.</p>

<p>"Why don't they fly towards the coast&mdash;towards
Georgia?" demanded Dot, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>Linda took her spyglasses out of her pocket,
and squinted through them at the plane.</p>

<p>"I see a boat!" she exclaimed. "It must be
that yacht the gang had arrangements with&mdash;to
pick up the stuff they steal.... Yes, and
that's another island.... Look, Dot&mdash;see if
I'm right."</p>

<p>The other girl took the glasses, and confirmed
Linda's statement.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is.... And the Ladybug's landing
on it.... Two people getting out&mdash;must be
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Susie and the Doc&mdash;and boarding the boat....
Linda! They're leaving the plane on the
island!"</p>

<p>It was true indeed; taking turns at the
glasses, the girls watched the yacht push off
into the ocean.</p>

<p>"And here we are&mdash;and there's the Ladybug!"
remarked Linda, grimly. "Just out of
reach! The question is&mdash;how to get to her."</p>

<p>"Swim," suggested Dot.</p>

<p>"Maybe you could, Dot. But I'd be afraid of
sharks."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I'll try it either. Besides,
the currents probably awfully strong."</p>

<p>"Oh, if Jackson and Hal would only rescue
us now!" lamented Linda. "I wouldn't treat
them a bit coolly."</p>

<p>The truth of that situation flashed upon Dot.</p>

<p>"Was it Jackson Carter who rescued you before,
Linda?" she asked.</p>

<p>Linda blushed. "Yes&mdash;it was," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Then why did you treat him so cruelly? I
should think you would have been everlastingly
grateful."</p>

<p>"I was. Till his mother snubbed me&mdash;and he
even doubted that I was a nice girl, just because
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I was traveling about alone. Then, when
you introduced me, he wanted to be friends.
Naturally I was hurt."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you! But Mrs. Carter is terribly
old-fashioned."</p>

<p>While they were talking they had been slowly
advancing towards the beach. Suddenly Linda
spied a pile of articles near the spot where the
autogiro had taken off.</p>

<p>"Look, Dot!" she cried. "There's our stuff
on the shore! The basket! My over-night bag&mdash;and
I guess that other box is my tool kit, that I
always keep in the plane! Come on!"</p>

<p>Breathlessly they dashed down to the shore
and found that their belongings had indeed been
tossed out of the autogiro.</p>

<p>"This proves that Susie's our friend!" cried
Linda, hopefully. "She must have done this."</p>

<p>"Fine friend&mdash;to steal the plane!" returned
Dot. "She didn't have to go with that man!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not.... I'm afraid I can't understand
her," mourned Linda. "Half good, and
half bad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about Susie," urged her companion.
"We have enough to think about for
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
ourselves.... Still, it is nice that we eat tonight.
Aren't we lucky to have that food?"</p>

<p>Dot's forced cheerfulness brought their
wretched plight back to Linda. How selfish she
had been, to drag this other girl into this
wretched business, when she came South to enjoy
a holiday!</p>

<p>"Oh, Dot!" she wailed, "I can't tell you how
sorry I am&mdash;about bringing you in on this! I
had no right to let you come. Your mother will
never forgive me. It was different with Lou.
When she set out on those wild adventures with
me, her parents knew what to expect."</p>

<p>"Cheer up, we're not dead yet," was the reassuring
reply. "Things aren't so black. Our
enemy is safely out of the country, I take it, and
Captain Magee is sure to look us up soon, when
he doesn't hear from us. Besides, a friendly
boat may come along at any minute."</p>

<p>"Dot, you're one girl in a thousand!" cried
Linda, giving her chum a hug. "You're just an
old peach, not to be complaining. And for my
own sake, I'm so thankful you're with me! Just
imagine how I'd feel all alone!"</p>

<p>"Well, let's enjoy ourselves while the food
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
lasts. Let's carry it inshore farther, and find
a camping place. You have matches in your
pocket?"</p>

<p>"Always!" replied Linda, thinking of her
experience in Canada, when she had lost her
matches with her plane. "I keep my pockets
as full as a man's now, so if I am separated
from my plane, I'm not helpless."</p>

<p>"Wise girl! You're learning, Linda. In a
year or two you can do exploring, like Byrd&mdash;if
there are any places left to explore."</p>

<p>"I guess Aunt Emily will make me sit home
with folded hands after this," remarked Linda,
soberly. "If we aren't rescued soon, it will be
bound to get into the newspapers."</p>

<p>She stooped over and opened her tool-box, in
which she carried all sorts of things besides
actual tools. A flash-light, a knife, wire and
string, even nails and nuts. And down in the
corner she found several cans of food, which she
thought the bandits had taken out when they
emptied the plane of its gas that first day in
the swamp.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a big help," she said.
"We might even build a boat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out of underbrush?" asked Dot, sarcastically.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"Why, there isn't a decent tree on the
whole island."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're right," sighed Linda.
"Well, come on&mdash;let's get farther in, and take
this money out of our clothing. Money can be
a nuisance sometimes," she added, jokingly.</p>

<p>They picked up their possessions, Linda taking
the tool-box, and Dot the bag and basket
of food, and hunted the shadiest spot they could
find for their camp. Then they set about diligently
unloading the money, and stuffing it into
the over-night bag, which they first emptied of
its contents.</p>

<p>"Let's see what we have to keep us alive,"
suggested Dot, peering into the basket. "Three
quarters of a chicken, ten oranges, almost a
whole cake, four bananas, and eight rolls, besides
that stuff you found. And one thermos
bottle full of water&mdash;and another half full."</p>

<p>"It's the lack of water that's going to make
it hardest," observed Linda. "If only the ocean
weren't salty."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe we shan't even need all this!
If we rig up some kind of signal of distress&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What shall we use? Clothing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"We might take hundred dollar bills,"
laughed Dot. "They're the most worthless
things we have now."</p>

<p>"True. Only think how glad the people will
be to get them back. Mrs. Carter, for instance....
I have it!" exclaimed Linda, brightly. "Our
pajamas! Lucky we put them into the bag! We
won't need them in the day-time, and no boat
could see a signal at night anyway."</p>

<p>"Good idea!" approved her chum. "Now
let's leave all this stuff here, and explore the
island. We might find something&mdash;and anyhow,
it will give us something to do."</p>

<p>Arm in arm they returned to the beach, where
the sand was harder, and began to circle the
island. They had gone half way around&mdash;to
the opposite shore&mdash;when they both spied the
old motor boat at the same moment. So great
was their joy that they jumped up and down,
hugging each other wildly.</p>

<p>"Of course that's what the man came in!"
cried Linda. "We might have known he and
Susie couldn't swim the ocean!"</p>

<p>They started to race to the boat, and arrived
together. Dot immediately set about examining
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
it for leaks, while Linda gave her attention to
the engine.</p>

<p>"It's broken," she said. "But I'm sure I
can fix it. You know how I love to take motors
apart. Just give me a day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Darling, you can have a week if you want!"
agreed Dot, wild with happiness and relief.
"We can make our food last."</p>

<p>"A day or maybe two ought to be enough.
Then we can get to that other island and retrieve
the Ladybug, before anybody even
misses us!"</p>

<p>"It seems to be pretty sound," said Dot. "No
leaks, or anything. And there are even a couple
of oars in the bottom, if the engine won't go."</p>

<p>"Oars wouldn't take us far, with such a
heavy boat. But I'm sure I can fix the motor,
and there's a can of gasoline here, besides
what's in the tank.... But I don't believe I
better start now&mdash;I'd just get it apart, and the
daylight would be gone. I'll get up early tomorrow...."</p>

<p>"Suits me," agreed the other. "Now let's
go back to our camp and fix some supper."</p>

<p>Both girls felt exceedingly cheerful as they
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
collected sticks and lighted a fire. From one of
Linda's cans they took out tea, but the rest they
left unopened. The beans and jam and biscuits
would keep until after the picnic food was gone.</p>

<p>"I have a bright idea," remarked Dot, as she
ate a leg of chicken. "Why couldn't we make
chicken soup, out of the bones and sea-water?
You have to put salt in it anyway, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm afraid it would be too salty.
It would make us so thirsty we'd want to drink
all our water at once.... Still, we might try.
We wouldn't be wasting anything."</p>

<p>"Too bad we haven't sore throats," said Dot,
still in a mood for joking.</p>

<p>"Sore throats!" repeated Linda, in amazement.
"What's the connection between chicken
soup and sore throats?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I was only trying to think up
ways to use salt water. We always have to
gargle with salt water, at home, when we have
sore throats. Doesn't your Aunt Emily make
you do that?"</p>

<p>Her companion laughed. "No, we always use
Listerine. But it's an idea. Think up some more,
Dot&mdash;we'll get some uses for it yet!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>They drank very sparingly of the water in
the thermos bottle&mdash;one cup apiece&mdash;and decided
to limit themselves to that at each meal.
Sometimes they would substitute oranges&mdash;how
thankful they were that they had brought so
many!</p>

<p>Their light-hardheartedness diminished as the
sun went down and darkness settled over the
island. The loneliness of the night, the solemn
roar of the ocean, the isolation of the island,
appalled them. Not a human being except themselves&mdash;not
a human sound!</p>

<p>But they had each other, and this comfort
was so overwhelming to Linda, that it shut out
all her other troubles. She could not help exulting
every few minutes over the joy of having
a companion, and Dot was thankful that she
was there, so long as Linda had to meet with
such a fate. Yes, surely, they would make the
best of things.</p>

<p>They slept well that night, for the sand, covered
with leaves the girls had plucked, made a
soft bed. A breeze from the ocean was so cooling
that Linda had to pull their slickers over
them as a covering. The stars shone in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
friendly sky; hand in hand, as Linda and Lou
had so often slept, the two girls dropped off
into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Their first thought upon awakening, after remembering
where they were, was the autogiro.
Their second was the motor-boat. They could
not eat any breakfast until they had made sure
that both of these were still safe.</p>

<p>"That island doesn't look very far away, does
it?" Dot remarked, after they had satisfied
themselves upon these two questions.</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't," agreed Linda, taking out
her spyglasses. "Only, you can't tell by appearances&mdash;they're
so deceiving on the ocean."</p>

<p>They went back to their camp and breakfasted
on oranges and rolls, finishing off with chocolate
cake.</p>

<p>"Because we might as well enjoy it while it is
fresh," Dot said laughingly. Neither girl ever
had to worry about indigestion.</p>

<p>All day long Linda worked on the engine,
with her companion at her side, watching her
in admiration. All that day and the next. On
the evening of the twenty-ninth of June she announced
that she was finished. The engine was
condescending to run!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tomorrow we get the Ladybug!" Linda
announced, exultantly. "And get back to Jacksonville
in time to keep our engagements for
July first!"</p>

<p>They were very happy as they sat beside their
camp fire that night, eating their supper of
baked beans and crackers and oranges. Happy
and light-hearted, never thinking to glance at
the sky, and to guess the meaning of the dark
clouds that were gathering. Had they only done
so, they might have gone to the autogiro that
night in their repaired motor-boat&mdash;and saved
their relatives and friends all the anguish and
anxiety that they were to experience during
the coming days.</p>

<p>But neither Linda nor Dot gave the weather
a thought; they went to sleep that night in the
joyful expectation of returning to Jacksonville
the following day.</p>

<p class="pmb3">At dawn the storm came, pouring down upon
them in torrents, arousing the ocean to terrifying
waves, shutting out the sight of the island
where the autogiro was waiting&mdash;imprisoning
the girls once more in their desolate loneliness.
And now practically all of their food was gone!</p>

<i>Searching Parties</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>When Linda Carlton and Dorothy Crowley
left Jacksonville Airport on the morning of
June twenty-seventh in the Ladybug, and flew
into the Okefenokee Swamp, they fully expected
to telephone to their families that night, or at
least to send a wire to them, as they had promised.
So when Miss Emily Carlton heard nothing
from her niece she became anxious, and
directed her chauffeur to drive her to Mrs.
Crowley's cottage.</p>

<p>Both women were established at Green Falls
for the summer, which was the favorite resort
of all Linda's friends from Spring City. It was
there that the girl had called her aunt from
Jacksonville, the night that Dot and the Mackays
had arrived. Only one telegram had she
received since that time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crowley, who was less inclined to be
nervous than Miss Carlton, tried to reassure the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
latter, saying that she realized how busy the
girls would be. But when June twenty-eighth
passed without any word from them, she too
became alarmed, and together the two women
put in a long distance call to Captain Magee at
Jacksonville.</p>

<p>Briefly he told them what he knew&mdash;of
Linda's decision to go "scouting," as she called
it. And of her request for the revolvers.</p>

<p>The shock of that piece of news was almost
too much for Miss Carlton. She jumped to the
conclusion that the girls were dead.</p>

<p>"Aren't you doing a thing to find them, Captain?"
she demanded, harshly.</p>

<p>"I was thinking about it," he replied. "But
after all, they've only been gone two days&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't know my niece!" interrupted the
unhappy woman. "Linda always wires or telephones
me every day, when she goes on these
flying trips. She doesn't forget. It's because
she can't&mdash;she has been injured or killed!"</p>

<p>"I hope not," he replied. "But I will send a
plane over the Okefenokee Swamp tomorrow,
Miss Carlton," he promised.</p>

<p>The two women gazed at each other in helpless
dismay at the conclusion of this conversation.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
What could they possibly do, aside from
informing the newspapers&mdash;a decision which
they carried out immediately.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on June twenty-ninth, every
newspaper in the country stated the fact that
Linda Carlton, the famous aviatrix who had
flown to Paris alone, was missing again&mdash;somewhere
in Georgia&mdash;probably in the Okefenokee
Swamp, with a chum, Miss Dorothy Crowley of
Spring City, who was also a pilot.</p>

<p>The unhappy news instantly produced the
effect which Miss Carlton hoped it would accomplish.
It aroused no fewer than five searching
parties, all bent upon locating these two
popular girls.</p>

<p>Captain Magee's men were the first to go.
Summoning Sergeant Worth, he commandeered
a plane from the airport, and directed the pilot
to fly over the swamp, searching from the air
by means of spyglasses.</p>

<p>The second party was composed of the girls'
fathers, both of whom were in New York City
at the time. Mr. Crowley telephoned Mr. Carlton,
and after sending a wire to their families,
they boarded a Florida train together.</p>

<p>The third volunteers were two young men
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
at Green Falls, two college boys who considered
Linda and Dot their special girl-friends,
though neither of them was engaged, Jim Valier
and Ralph Clavering heard the sad news at the
out-door pool at Green Falls, just as they were
about to join a group of young people for a
swim. Kitty Hulbert, Ralph's married sister,
read the head-lines aloud.</p>

<p>"Jim," muttered Ralph, when Kitty finished,
"let's do something! We can take a plane to
Florida&mdash;and go on a search from there."</p>

<p>"O.K.," agreed the other boy, and quietly
and quickly the two young men disappeared
from the group.</p>

<p>The story came to the Mackays in Washington,
where Ted had business on his return from
Georgia. The instant that Louise read it, she
jumped up in excitement.</p>

<p>"We must go, Ted!" she cried. "You can get
your vacation now."</p>

<p>"I'll wire immediately," he agreed, without
an instant's hesitation, and he went out to make
the necessary arrangements and to order his
plane in readiness.</p>

<p>The fifth and last party was none other than
Linda's two latest admirers, the two young
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
men she had mentioned to Dot in the hope of a
rescue&mdash;Jackson Carter and Hal Perry.</p>

<p>All in all, it ought to have been enough to
satisfy Miss Carlton that every effort was being
made to find the girls and to bring them back
to safety.</p>

<p>The airplane from the police department was
the first of these groups to get into action, the
first to enter the swamp. Yet it did not actually
enter it, but merely flew above it, for the pilot,
less experienced than Linda herself, did not
believe it possible to come down on one of those
islands. For hours, however, he circled about,
over the bog, and the cypress-trees, while Sergeant
Worth in the rear cock-pit scanned the
landscape with his spyglasses. But neither man
saw any trace of the autogiro or the girls, and
late that afternoon they had to return in discouragement
to Captain Magee.</p>

<p>"I couldn't even locate that camp on the
island," Worth said. "The one where we got
the prisoners, you know. Unless you have the
exact directions, it's hard to find anything in
that swamp.... And&mdash;I don't see much use
in trying again."</p>

<p>Captain Magee looked exceedingly grave; he
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
was genuinely worried. He blamed himself for
letting the girls go alone. But there had been
nothing official about the project&mdash;he had not
really expected that they would run into the
criminal. Besides, Linda Carlton had seemed so
capable, and both girls were so eager to go.</p>

<p>"We mustn't give up, Worth," he said
quietly. "It's more important to find these girls
than a dozen criminals. We owe it to them, to
their families&mdash;to the whole country. Everybody
has admiration and affection for Miss
Linda Carlton, after all she has done....
You'll have to go back tomorrow&mdash;or get another
man, if you feel too discouraged."</p>

<p>"No, I'm only too glad to help," the other
assured him. "I would do anything in the world
for Miss Carlton. But I don't see how it can do
any good. A scouting party in boats would be
much more likely to be successful."</p>

<p>"We'll try that, too, as soon as I can get some
men together. But tomorrow you fly out over the
ocean to that island where the thieves had the
jewels. The girls might be stranded there. Take
another pilot, and a bigger plane."</p>

<p>Worth looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"We haven't any way of locating that island,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
either," he said. "It was Miss Carlton who
took us there before, and I have no idea where
it is."</p>

<p>"Just do your best, Worth," urged the Captain.
"Fly around all the islands near the
Georgia coast, keeping a sharp look-out for the
autogiro."</p>

<p>"Rain or shine? It looks like a storm tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, whatever the weather, you must go&mdash;or
get someone else."</p>

<p>So, in spite of the terrible downpour and the
high winds of June thirtieth, a cabin monoplane
flew across Georgia and out over the ocean to
a group of islands just off the coast. Three men
were aboard&mdash;two experienced pilots, one of
whom was also a mechanic&mdash;besides the police
officer.</p>

<p>Leaving the coast behind, they flew out into
the grayness that was ocean and sky. The waves
were high, the sea rough and angry, and the
rain was coming down in sheets, blinding their
vision, but they pressed on, two of the men
keeping their spyglasses on the water, watching
for islands. They passed over several, but
they were small, with little or no place to land.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Eagerly the men watched for some sign of
human life, some signal, some glimpse of the
autogiro.</p>

<p>"They'd never be alive if we did find them,"
remarked Worth, gloomily. "And if they did
run into that gangster, he'd surely have made
away with them."</p>

<p>"If only it would clear up," grumbled the
pilot. "So we could see something!"</p>

<p>They were flying much lower now, for it was
comparatively safe over the water, and despite
the weather, they were able to spot the
islands. All of a sudden the mechanic uttered
a sharp cry.</p>

<p>"There she is! Look! Over there!"</p>

<p>"Miss Carlton?" demanded Worth, excitedly.
"Where?"</p>

<p>"Not the girl! The plane&mdash;the autogiro!
See&mdash;that island to the west! See the wind-mill
on top?"</p>

<p>"By George! You're right!" agreed Worth,
a thrill running up and down his spine. Thank
Heaven, he hadn't given up!</p>

<p>The pilot directed the plane over the island
and circled about, landing finally some distance
from the autogiro. A glance at the latter assured
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
them that it had not been wrecked. Why,
then, hadn't the girls come back? Was it possible
that all this scare had risen to alarm the
world for the simple reason that Linda Carlton
had run out of gas?</p>

<p>The three men climbed out of the cabin and
shouted as loud as they could, since the girls
had evidently failed to hear their plane, above
the noise of the storm and the roar of the ocean.
Eagerly they waited for a reply. But when none
came, fear crept over them all.</p>

<p>Had the girls died of starvation, or was there
foul play of some kind? With gloomy forebodings,
they walked about the beach, seeking
evidence of some kind to tell the story of what
had happened.</p>

<p>Finding nothing, the mechanic began to examine
the autogiro. She was undamaged, unhurt&mdash;everything
in order, gasoline in the tank.
The engine started easily in answer to his test,
and ran smoothly until he turned it off. No,
the gallant little Ladybug could not be blamed
for whatever disaster had taken place!</p>

<p>Then, forgetful of the weather, the three men
set out to search the island thoroughly. Buckled
in oil-skin coats, they felt protected themselves,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
but Worth shuddered as he thought of these
girls alone in such desolation, with no roof to
cover them, no food to satisfy their hunger, or
water for their thirst. Gloomy and discouraged
they plowed through the wet sand, calling
the girls' names. Finally, abandoning the hope
of finding them alive, they set themselves to
the gruesome task of looking among the underbrush
for their bodies. At last they gave up.</p>

<p>"We'll fasten a canvas sheet over these
bushes, so that we can locate the island, and
we'll pin a note on it to say that we'll be back,"
decided Worth, "in case they are alive. One of
you men take the autogiro, and the other the
plane, and we'll go back now."</p>

<p>The rain was abating somewhat, and the two
planes made the return trip without any mishaps,
arriving at the Jacksonville Airport before
dark that evening.</p>

<p>A wildly enthusiastic crowd, which had collected
in spite of the weather, greeted them
with resounding cheers. The Ladybug was back
again&mdash;safe and sound! Women cried with joy,
men threw their hats into the air, children
clapped their hands and whistled. In a miniature
way it was a demonstration like the one
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
given Lindbergh upon his arrival at the French
Flying Field. But it was a false rejoicing, and
the gayety was quickly changed into despair
when the pilot reported that the girls themselves
had not been found.</p>

<p>Weary and disappointed, the crowd turned
away, and Sergeant Worth told the sad story
to the newspaper reporters who waited to interview
him, before he returned to the police headquarters.</p>

<p>Captain Magee was terribly affected by the
news. Linda Carlton might have been his own
daughter, from the grief which he could not
conceal.</p>

<p>Two well-dressed young men were waiting
in his office when Worth arrived, and they listened
to the grim account. They were the first
of the rescue parties to arrive from the North&mdash;Jim
Valier and Ralph Clavering.</p>

<p>"These two young men are friends of Miss
Carlton and Miss Crowley," explained the Captain.
"They want to go into the swamp tomorrow
in a boat.... Perhaps the girls have
reached the main-land, or perhaps that autogiro
was stolen, and they never were on the island
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
at all.... Anyhow, we'll search the swamp
again. Will you go with them, Worth?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," agreed the sergeant, though he
felt as if it would be fruitless. Those girls were
at the bottom of the ocean, he was sure!</p>

<p>"A light motor-boat ought to be able to go
up that little stream," continued the Captain.
"I will have one ready at the edge of the swamp
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. If you young
men will come here at nine, I'll send you over
there in a car."</p>

<p>Jim and Ralph expressed their thanks to the
officer, and promised to be on hand at the arranged
time in the morning. But, like Sergeant
Worth, they were exceedingly discouraged; they
had little hope of success.</p>

<p>When they awakened the following morning,
which was the first day of July&mdash;the day that
Linda should have reported to Atlanta&mdash;they
found that it was still raining, although the
storm had ceased, giving way to a dismal drizzle.
What an unpleasant day to start off on an
excursion like theirs, that was gloomy at best!
Yet the weather did not deter them from their
purpose, nor did it stop Hal Perry and Jackson
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
who started earlier that morning in their canoe.</p>

<p>But it was difficult with a motor-boat, and
all three of the men were unfamiliar with the
swamp and its little streams. No one knew where
to turn off, as Jackson and Hal had learned
from many vacations, and after pushing ahead
for two or three hours, they found themselves
off their course&mdash;grounded.</p>

<p>"It's no use," muttered Worth. "We can't
make it in a motor-boat. Magee's never been
in the swamp, or he would have known. We'll
have to turn back and get a canoe!"</p>

<p>"A whole day wasted!" growled Ralph angrily,
as if it were the sergeants fault. "A day!
When every minute is precious!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's nobody's fault," remarked Worth.
"The sooner we get back the better."</p>

<p>"Nobody's fault!" repeated Ralph. "No&mdash;ignorance
is O.K.&mdash;if it pertains to the police!
They shouldn't know a thing about the country
around them!"</p>

<p>"No use getting mad at policemen, Ralph,"
drawled good-natured Jim Valier. "Haven't
you learned from driving a car that it doesn't
pay? Besides, they're always right."</p>

<p>"No, we're often very wrong," said Worth,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
humbly and seriously. "And maybe you don't
think I care, Mr. Clavering, about finding those
girls. But I do! I haven't thought about a thing
but that for the last three days."</p>

<p>Ralph made no answer, but applied his attention
to searching the landscape with his
glasses. But, like everybody else thus far, he
found nothing.</p>

<p>Discouraged and silent, they managed to push
the boat into the deeper water and to turn it
around. All that afternoon they spent in retracing
the progress they had made, and returned
to the Captain's office just before supper.</p>

<p>"You want to try it again in canoes?" asked
Captain Magee.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ralph. "Without any of your
police this time. No use taking an extra man&mdash;it
only means more provisions to carry."</p>

<p>"True. But you must be careful of snakes
and alligators."</p>

<p>The boys looked none too pleased at the idea,
but when they remembered that Linda and Dot,
if still alive, would be subjected to the same
perils, they were all the more eager to go.</p>

<p>This time, they decided, they would do it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
scientifically; they would go prepared with a
map of the swamp, equipment, food, and rifles.
And above all, a compass! And they would not
give up until they had searched every part of
that dismal Okefenokee Swamp!</p>

<p class="pmb3">So, cheered by the optimism of youth and the
promise of another day, the boys slept well
that night.</p>

<h2><a id="Chapter_XV"><span class="smcap">Chapter XV</span></a><br /><br />

<i>The Empty Island</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>The same morning upon which Ralph Clavering
and Jim Valier went into the Okefenokee
Swamp in a canoe, the fourth searching party
arrived. Delayed by a stop-over in Norfolk,
Virginia, where Ted had some business for the
company, he and Louise did not reach the Jacksonville
Airport until the morning of July
second. Leaving the plane at the field, they
taxied immediately to the City Hall, arriving
there a little after ten.</p>

<p>They did not expect any good news about
the missing girls, for they had read the papers
and had inquired the latest word at the airport.
They had gazed at the Ladybug, so forlorn
and desolate in the hangar, and their fears
were dark. Even Louise, who was usually optimistic,
believed this time it was the end. Yet
how dreadful it was! That Linda Carlton, so
young, with such a glorious future before her,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
should perish like this before she was twenty!
When she had the whole world at her feet&mdash;a
world she had won not through mere beauty
and charm&mdash;although she was both beautiful
and charming, but through her courage, her
ability, her modesty! Louise made no attempt
to hide the tears that rolled down her cheeks;
even her husband's strong arm about her shoulders
could not stop her sobs.</p>

<p>"Don't give up yet, dear!" he urged. "Why,
you and I haven't even had our try."</p>

<p>The girl smiled bravely through her tears.</p>

<p>"I know, Ted dear. I'll try to remember."
Her eyes brightened with genuine hope. "It
always has been <i>you</i> who have rescued her!
Maybe you will this time."</p>

<p>"We're going to make a bigger effort than
ever before," he reassured her. "Because this
time I have you to help me."</p>

<p>The minute they entered the City Hall they
saw that something had happened. Louise's
heart gave a wild leap of excitement. Were
Linda and Dot safe?</p>

<p>But no. If they were, somebody would be
shouting the news from the house-tops&mdash;and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
no one was looking particularity jubilant. There
was a crowd outside, but it was not an exulting
one. Was it possible that they had found
the girls&mdash;dead? In spite of the heat of the
day, a cold shiver of horror crept over Louise,
and she clung tightly to her husband's arm.</p>

<p>They had little difficulty in passing through
the crowd to the captain's office, for the latter
had given orders to his men that Miss Carlton's
and Miss Crowley's friends and relatives were
to be admitted immediately, whenever they appeared.</p>

<p>As they entered the room, they saw half a
dozen officials standing around, several in plain
clothes, with only badges to identify them. And
on a chair by the desk, opposite Captain Magee,
a strange young woman was sitting.</p>

<p>The girl was flashily dressed&mdash;or over-dressed&mdash;in
the latest style. A long green gown trailed
almost to the floor, not quite concealing a
bandaged ankle. Her little, off-the-face hat of
the same bright color was decorated with a
diamond bar-pin. Her lips and her cheeks were
painted, and there was a gap in her mouth
where two front teeth had been knocked out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The Captain nodded to the Mackays to sit
down, and he continued the questions he was
putting to this young woman.</p>

<p>"You might as well confess if you know where
that man is&mdash;with all the bank's money!" he
was saying. "I know your scheme. Pretending
you don't know where he escaped, so that you
won't be locked up, and can get back to him!"
His eyes narrowed, and he lowered his voice
to an uncanny whisper. "But we'll keep you
here till you tell where that thief is!"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you&mdash;when I don't know!" she
persisted. "He ran off from me&mdash;he never
wanted me with him anyway. I'll swear to it,
Sir, if you think I'm lyin'.... Besides, he
hasn't got that money."</p>

<p>"Then where is it?"</p>

<p>"Linda&mdash;and the cops she had with her&mdash;tricked
us, double-crossed us, by swiping the
money and fillin' the bags with sand. The Doc
was in such a Hurry to get away from those
cops, he never found it out till we were on
that yacht. He was afraid to go back."</p>

<p>Captain Magee leaned forward eagerly at the
mention of Linda Carlton's name. She was far
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
more important than the money that had been
stolen.</p>

<p>"Miss Carlton?" he demanded. "With the
police? Where did you see her?"</p>

<p>Susie shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't actually see her. But I saw her
Bug, with her stuff in it&mdash;a bag and a basket
of food. I tossed them out of the plane, too, so
she wouldn't starve when we swiped the plane.
You can put that down to my credit."</p>

<p>"You stole the autogiro?"</p>

<p>"No. Only borrowed it. Left it on an island&mdash;you
can get it when you want it."</p>

<p>"We have it.... Now, suppose instead of
my asking you questions, you tell us the whole
story, Miss&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mrs.</i> Slider, if you please," she said. "I am
a widow." She lowered her eyes dramatically,
enjoying the sensation of holding the center
of the stage.</p>

<p>"Well," she began, "after my husband got
killed in the plane accident that Linda probably
told you about, she and I got to be quite good
friends. I even promised to leave the gang and
go straight, for I never really took part in any
of their stealing myself&mdash;believe it or not!
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Linda left me on that island in the swamp, and
promised to come back for me when she came
for the Bug."</p>

<p>"But you weren't there when Miss Carlton
returned!" Captain Magee reminded her.</p>

<p>"No. I got terrible lonesome. If you ever
spend a night in the swamp with only a dead
man for company&mdash;oh, he was buried all right,
but it was spooky just the same&mdash;you'd excuse
me for takin' the first way out, Sir. The Doc
come along, in his canoe, and I promised him
my diamond ring if he'd take me away....
Well, we got out of the swamp in his boat, and
hired a Ford across Georgia. Then we took a
motor-boat out to that island in the ocean."</p>

<p>Everyone waited breathlessly; at last the girl
was coming to the part they all longed to hear
about&mdash;the part of the story in which Linda
Carlton figured. Pausing dramatically, Susie
asked for a glass of water.</p>

<p>"Go on!" urged the captain, as soon as she
had drained it.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible boat," she finally continued.
"An awful old one. You can imagine going
ten miles out to sea in a thing like that! The
engine gave out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind all that!" commanded the officer,
impatiently. "Come to the point."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir.... Well, we got to the island
finally, and waited for the yacht that was to
pick us up and take us to Panama, but before
she come along, the autogiro arrived. Linda&mdash;and
the police, of course."</p>

<p>"Did you see them&mdash;the police, I mean?"
was the next question.</p>

<p>"No, we didn't. We were too scared, so we
hid till they got out of the plane and searched
the island. Then we grabbed the bags and ran
for the plane. I flew the Bug out to sea, and
in a few minutes we spotted our yacht, and
signaled it to stop on another island. That's
where we left Linda's plane.... When we got
to Panama, the Doc slipped off, and I got
caught.... So you see there's nothing to punish
<i>me</i> for&mdash;you got the autogiro back, and the
cops, or Linda, took the money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There were no policemen with Miss Carlton,"
Captain Magee informed Susie. "Only
another girl. But they are lost."</p>

<p>"They must be still on that island, waiting
for you to come for them. Nothing could hurt
them, and they had some food...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>This was enough for Ted Mackay. Jumping
to his feet, he announced his intention of flying
there immediately.</p>

<p>"Give me the latitude and longitude of that
island!" he demanded. "There isn't a moment
to lose!"</p>

<p>"The what?" asked Susie, wrinkling her
nose.</p>

<p>"Show me where it is on a map," explained
Ted.</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Susie, pointing out the
island on a map of the Georgia coast, which
the Captain took from his desk. "But what's
the grand rush?"</p>

<p>"You've forgotten the storm we just had!"
said the young man. "The girls may be sick
or dead by this time."</p>

<p>"Girls," repeated Susie, significantly. "It
beats everything the way they fooled us&mdash;in
their riding-breeches! If the Doc ever finds out
he ran away from a pair of girls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind all that, Mrs. Slider," interrupted
Captain Magee, signaling to the prison
matron to take the girl away.... "Now, Mr.
Mackay, is there anything I can do for you,
before you go?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might get me a taxi," replied Ted. "To
take my wife and myself to the airport."</p>

<p>"Take my private car," offered the Captain,
rising to say good-by. "And good luck to
you!"</p>

<p>Louise was so excited at the whole occurrence
that she could scarcely sit still in the limousine,
as it sped over to the airport.</p>

<p>"If we only aren't too late! Ted, do you
suppose they're starved? What does it feel
like to starve to death? Or to die of thirst?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry too much about thirst,"
he reassured her. "Because of that big rain we
had. They could get water from it, you know."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that!"</p>

<p>"The worst is over now, I'm sure," continued
Ted. "Five days isn't so long, and the
girl said they had food. Besides, it wasn't cold.
Think of that time you girls were lost in Canada!"</p>

<p>Louise shuddered; she could still remember
that long, hopeless night very vividly, when
she and Linda had jumped from parachutes
down into the snow of the Canadian Woods,
and how they had been forced to keep walking
to avoid freezing to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, we found a shack to sleep in. And
Linda and Dot haven't even a blanket to cover
them in all that storm!"</p>

<p>"Well, they were together, that's one thing
to be thankful for."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and I'm glad Linda's companion is
Dot. Of all our crowd at Spring City, Dot
Crowley is the nicest girl&mdash;after Linda, of
course. Most of the girls, like Kitty Clavering&mdash;Kitty
Hulbert, I mean&mdash;or Sue Emery, would
be pitying themselves so that they'd make Linda
miserable. But not Dot. She always sees the
bright side of everything."</p>

<p>"And wasn't it clever the way they got hold
of that money, and fooled that bandit!" exulted
Ted. "My, but that was slick. And think what
it's going to mean to that bank and its depositors!
Because if that fellow hadn't been
fooled, he'd have made off with it. I don't believe
they'll ever find him now."</p>

<p>"I guess nobody will care if he never comes
back to the United States!" agreed Louise.</p>

<p>They arrived at the airport and found the
plane in readiness, wheeled out on the runway,
and Ted took time to give it an inspection himself,
while Louise ran off to get the necessary
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
supplies&mdash;some food and water, and a first-aid
kit, as a necessary precaution. She borrowed
sweaters and knickers from the supply at the
airport, for she reasoned that Linda and Dot
would be chilled and drenched from the rain.
Dry clothing ought to be a god-send, even if
they used it only on the short trip back in the
plane.</p>

<p>Inside of an hour they took off. It was still
drizzling, but Ted was such an experienced
navigator that he had no difficulty at all in
flying in any kind of weather, and he found the
island from Susie's directions. Shortly after
noon, he brought it down on the beach.</p>

<p>A feeling of apprehension stole over Louise,
when she saw neither of the girls on the shore
to greet them. In spite of the noise of ocean,
surely they would have heard the plane! Why
weren't they there?</p>

<p>Ted turned off the motor, and looked about
expectantly.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they're both sick&mdash;or injured?"
faltered Louise. She did not add, "or
dead," but she could not help thinking it.</p>

<p>"Maybe they didn't hear us. Let's shout together&mdash;'Linda
and Dot!' If they hear their
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
first names, they'll know we're friends, maybe
recognize our voices. You see they may be
hiding&mdash;for fear it's that gangster returning."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," replied Louise,
more hopefully. "All right&mdash;both together when
I count three.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three!"</p>

<p>"LINDA AND DOT!"</p>

<p>Their voices rose clearly over the splashing
of the waves, and they waited tensely.</p>

<p>But there was no reply!</p>

<p>They waited, and tried again.... Still silence....
Louise put out her hand, and
grasped her husband's, in fear.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she cried, in anguish.
"Is this surely the right island? There seemed
to be a lot of them."</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't" he answered, optimistically.
"That girl seemed to be telling the truth&mdash;but
she was a queer one. Besides, she might not be
sure which island it was.... Anyway, we'll
search. If Linda and Dot were here, we'll see
some evidences of their camp&mdash;burnt out fires,
or worn paths, or something. Come on, let's
start!"</p>

<p>Arm in arm they began their search, stepping
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
carefully through the underbrush, now and then
stopping to call, "Linda" or "Dot," in the
hope that the girls might only have been asleep.
They did not have to go far before they saw
that at least someone had been here recently,
for there was a path worn through the underbrush.</p>

<p>Farther and farther in they went, until they
came to a small cluster of pine trees. And here,
sure enough, they found the remains, or rather
the ashes, for the place had been left neat, of
a camp fire.</p>

<p>The sight of this forsaken spot brought sudden
tears to Louise's eyes.</p>

<p>"They've been dragged off and killed! I just
know it!" she moaned.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, please, dear," begged Ted.
"We're not sure yet. This may not be their
island&mdash;their fire. Somebody else may have
camped here. Let's look about a bit."</p>

<p>Slowly they walked around the place, examining
the ground for some forgotten belonging
that would identify the former campers. Noticing
a pile of leaves where someone had evidently
made a bed, Louise kicked them aside
with her foot, and she saw an empty matchbox.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
It wasn't much, but it was something, and
she leaned over and picked it up.</p>

<p>The letters on the lid leaped out at her like
living tongues. Marked with a purple rubber-stamp
over the trade-mark, were the words:</p>

<p>"J. Vetter, Spring City, Ohio."</p>

<p>The explanation was only too plain. No one
but Dot and Linda could have used that box.
Louise dropped to the ground in an agony of
wretchedness, and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Even the optimistic Ted found all his hopes
blasted by this little box. Gloom spread over
his features, and he sat down beside his wife,
comforting her as best he could.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes, perhaps, they remained
motionless, overcome by the thought of their
friends' awful death. The food which they had
brought with the idea of sharing a gay picnic
lunch with Dot and Linda was forgotten. Though
they had not eaten since breakfast, neither Ted
nor Louise could have swallowed a mouthful.</p>

<p>At last Ted got up, gently raising Louise to
her feet. Each silently decided to make one more
search&mdash;a gruesome one this time&mdash;for the girls'
bodies.</p>

<p>Round and round the island they walked,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
looking carefully, among the underbrush, near
to the beach, even scanning the water with their
spyglasses. But they saw nothing. That one
matchbox had been their only evidence. Like
good campers to the end, Linda and Dot had
burned every trace of rubbish.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon when Ted realized that
Louise was faint from hunger and thirst, and
he made her sit down while he brought some
supplies from the plane. She drank the water
eagerly, but she could not eat. For Louise
Mackay was going through the deepest tragedy
of her young life: her first experience with the
loss of a loved one.</p>

<p class="pmb3">During the entire flight homeward she kept
her hand on Ted's knee, but she did not utter
a word.</p>

<h2><a id="Chapter_XVI"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI</span></a><br /><br />

<i>Searching the Ocean</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Louise and Ted Mackay did not go to the
police headquarters that night. They were too
miserable, too discouraged by the outcome of
their excursion to the island. After leaving the
plane at the airport, Ted called Captain Magee
on the telephone, and briefly related the results
of their flight.</p>

<p>Supper was a dreary affair for them both.
It was only by putting forth a tremendous effort
that they ate at all&mdash;in an attempt to stave
off exhaustion. The ice cream, at least, tasted
good to Louise, for she was still very hot.</p>

<p>The worst ordeal of all came after the meal,
just as the saddened young couple were passing
through the hotel lobby to take the elevator
to their room. Louise suddenly recognized two
familiar figures at the desk, two men who had
just arrived with their luggage. Mr. Crowley
and Mr. Carlton&mdash;the fathers of the two unfortunate
girls!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The tears which Louise had bravely forced
back ever since her collapse at the discovery of
the matchbox on the island, rushed to her eyes
again. How could they ever tell these two men
the terrible news?</p>

<p>For an instant she hoped they would not
see her or her husband, that she could at least
put off the evil tidings until the morning. But
it was not to be. Linda's father recognized her
instantly, and came quickly towards her.</p>

<p>"Louise!" he exclaimed, holding out his hand.
"And Ted! Any news?"</p>

<p>Louise could not answer for the sob that was
choking her, and Ted, shy as he always was,
knew it was his duty to explain.</p>

<p>"Bad news, Sir," he said. "We had information
this morning that the girls were
stranded on an island in the ocean, and that
their autogiro had been stolen from them. As
you probably read in the newspaper, it was
found yesterday.... We&mdash;Lou and I&mdash;flew to
the island where the girls were supposed to be,
this afternoon, and found evidences of their
camp&mdash;burnt out fires&mdash;but no trace of the
girls."</p>

<p>Mr. Carlton looked grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"But they may have been rescued," suggested
Mr. Crowley, who had the same optimistic
disposition as his daughter.</p>

<p>"Possibly," admitted Ted. "But if they had,
wouldn't we have heard? The whole country is
waiting for news of those two brave girls."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're right," agreed Mr. Carlton,
darkly. "Yes, you must be right. Foul
play&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or the ocean!" put in Louise. "Oh, the
cruel, dreadful ocean! If it couldn't swallow
Linda up on her flight to Paris, it had to have
its revenge now!"</p>

<p>"Have you had your dinner, Sir?" asked
Ted of Mr. Carlton.</p>

<p>"Yes. On the train. Suppose we get our rooms&mdash;I'll
ask for a private sitting-room&mdash;and then
we can all go up and discuss the matter together
from every angle, and decide upon what
is the best thing for us to do."</p>

<p>Louise brightened at this ray of hope.</p>

<p>"Then you're not going to give up yet, Mr.
Carlton?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Never, till we find them&mdash;dead or alive.
We're going to think of no news as good news."</p>

<p>Mr. Crowley nodded his approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have a week's vacation," added Ted,
"and I shall be at your service."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my boy," answered Mr. Carlton,
gratefully. He was a great admirer of Ted Mackay,
ever since he had recovered from his prejudice
against him because he was the son of a
ne'er-do-well.</p>

<p>The new-comers made their arrangements at
the desk, and were fortunate enough to secure
a very pleasant suite. Louise and Ted went up
in the elevator with them, and Mr. Carlton ordered
coffee to be sent to the room.</p>

<p>They settled down into the easy chairs and
Louise poured the iced-coffee. The evening was
hot, but there were large windows on three
sides of the sitting-room, and a lovely breeze
was blowing. Mr. Carlton brought out cigars
and offered one to Ted.</p>

<p>"But I suppose you'd rather have a cigarette,"
he said, when Ted refused.</p>

<p>"No thank you, Sir. I never smoke. A great
many of us pilots don't. We want to keep as
fit as possible."</p>

<p>Mr. Carlton nodded. Linda had never expressed
any desire to smoke, and he supposed
it was for the same reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are two places where the girls might
be," he said slowly, as he puffed on his cigar.
"On another of those small islands, off the
coast, or in some boat&mdash;on the ocean. If they
had reached the coast, we should have heard
of it."</p>

<p>"A boat!" repeated Louise, with sudden inspiration.
"There was that broken down motor-boat,
that the girl and the gangster used to get
to the island! Could Dot and Linda have gone
off in that?"</p>

<p>"What boat?" demanded Mr. Carlton and
Mr. Crowley, both at once.</p>

<p>Louise explained by repeating most of the
story which they had heard from Susie that
morning.</p>

<p>"Funny we didn't think of that before," observed
Ted. "Come to remember, I didn't see
any boat this afternoon. Did you, Lou?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. And we searched the whole
island," she explained to the older men. "We'd
surely have seen it if there had been one."</p>

<p>"This sounds hopeful!" exclaimed Mr. Crowley,
joyfully. "If it didn't have a leak&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But didn't you say that it was broken?"
asked Mr. Carlton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"The girl said the engine was broken, but
as far as I know, the boat itself was sound,"
replied Ted.</p>

<p>"Linda could fix the engine!" cried Louise,
almost hysterical in her relief. For the first
time since the finding of the matchbox, she
actually believed that Linda and Dot were still
alive.</p>

<p>"We'll work on that theory, anyway," decided
Mr. Carlton. "And go out on the ocean
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Before they could discuss their plans any
further, the telephone on the desk interrupted
them, and Mr. Carlton was informed that there
were two young men who wanted to see him&mdash;Ralph
Clavering and James Valier.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" exclaimed Mr. Carlton,
who had not even known that the boys had
started South. "Yes," he added to the clerk
on the phone, "ask them to come up right
away, by all means."</p>

<p>"Who? What?" demanded Louise, eagerly.
"Any news?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. Ralph and Jim are here."</p>

<p>"They would be," smiled Louise. Linda could
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
never get away from Ralph Clavering, no matter
how far she went.</p>

<p>A minute later the boys appeared, dressed
in camping clothes, looking very unlike the
neat, immaculate young men they always appeared
to be at Spring City, or at Green Falls.
Even if they took part in athletics at home,
their white flannels were always spotless. But
now, except for the fact that their faces were
clean and shaved, they looked like tramps.</p>

<p>Ralph and Jim were just as much surprised
to see Ted and Louise as the latter were at
their visit.</p>

<p>"Where in the world have you been?" demanded
Louise, in amazement at their appearance.
"You both look as if you had been ship-wrecked
and lost besides."</p>

<p>"We have," muttered Jim, sinking wearily
into a seat, and extending his long legs in front
of him. "Please pardon our slouching, Lou&mdash;but
we're dead."</p>

<p>"But where have you been?" repeated Mr.
Carlton.</p>

<p>"In the Okefenokee Swamp!" answered
Ralph. "And if Lou weren't here, I'd tell you
what it's like, in no uncertain language!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Carlton smiled, and yet he was horror
stricken. If these boys found it so dreadful,
what must it have seemed like to Linda?</p>

<p>"Tell us about it!" he urged. "But wait,
have you had your supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We had food along with us. We left
the canoe at the edge of the stream, and taxied
back here, because we have rooms in this hotel.
They told us at the desk that 'Miss Carlton's
father had arrived,' so we didn't wait
even to change our clothing. We had to get the
news of the girls immediately."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there isn't much to tell," sighed
Louise. "At least nothing hopeful." Briefly she
repeated what she and Ted had been doing all
afternoon, as a result of Susie's capture and
story, and she displayed the matchbox, with
the name of Spring City stamped on its lid.</p>

<p>"I recall Linda's getting that from her
aunt," remarked Ralph, dolefully. "She asked
for half a dozen boxes, and Miss Carlton got
them right away, so she wouldn't forget."</p>

<p>"Now tell us what you boys have been doing,"
urged Mr. Crowley. "And Louise, why
don't you pour them some of this iced-coffee?
It really is very refreshing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Briefly Ralph told his story, aided now and
then by Jim. Their second expedition into the
swamp had been as useless as their first, though
they admitted the superiority of a canoe over
a motor-boat, if one knew where to go. But they
had become hopelessly lost in a couple of hours,
in spite of their maps, and, as time passed,
they became all the more certain that the girls
were not in the swamp. They decided to turn
back, in order to concentrate their efforts on
the islands near where the autogiro had been
found.</p>

<p>Susie's story naturally confirmed their suspicions,
and they instantly agreed with Mr.
Carlton to abandon all further search of the
Okefenokee.</p>

<p>"I believe the thing to do," announced the
latter, after serious contemplation, "is to hire
a yacht, and cruise all along the Georgia and
Florida coast. The most reasonable explanation
to me is that Linda and Dot are adrift somewhere
in that motor-boat. Either the engine is
broken beyond repair, or the gasoline has given
out."</p>

<p>"Or that terrible storm has wrecked them,"
faltered Louise, who could not silence her fear
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of the ocean. "Upset that little boat, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Lou!" cried Jim. "Don't even think
of things like that, unless we find an empty
boat!"</p>

<p>"I'll try not to," she promised.</p>

<p>"Well, whatever has happened, the ocean is
the place for us to be, if we hope to rescue the
girls," concluded Mr. Carlton, "You all agree
on that point?"</p>

<p>Everyone assented, and Ralph and Jim expressed
their desire to get into action immediately.</p>

<p>"We ought to be able to get a yacht tomorrow,"
continued Mr. Carlton. "Because of the
publicity of this affair someone who has one
ready will probably be glad to rent it to us on
the spot. I think I'll go to the newspaper office
tonight, and have the request broadcast by
radio."</p>

<p>"Great!" exclaimed Louise, jumping up excitedly.
"And can we all go with you tomorrow,
on the cruise, I mean, Mr. Carlton?"</p>

<p>"You can do just as you prefer&mdash;go with me,
or use your own plane to fly around over the
islands."</p>

<p>"I think that would be the better plan for
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
us, Sir," put in Ted. "And we can keep in
touch with you by signals."</p>

<p>The group separated at last, the older men
to call their families by long-distance, the young
people to get a good night's sleep after their
strenuous day. In the morning they re-assembled
at breakfast, when Mr. Carlton announced
the good news that he had been offered a yacht
by a wealthy man in Jacksonville.</p>

<p>"He even refused to take any rent for it,
much as I urged him to," he added. "And he's
lending us the crew besides. It seems too good
to be true."</p>

<p>"All of which goes to show just how popular
Linda is&mdash;with everybody!" explained Louise.
"Oh, we simply must find her!"</p>

<p>There were no preparations to be made for
the cruise, because the owner of the yacht assured
Mr. Carlton that everything was in readiness,
so by ten o'clock on the morning of July
third, the little party, composed of the two
fathers and the two boy-friends of the lost girls
stepped aboard the boat. It was a beautiful
little yacht, complete in every detail. Under
any other circumstances the men would have
been overjoyed at the prospect of such a pleasant
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
trip. As it was, they were too worried to
think of anything but Linda and Dot.</p>

<p>"What a marvelous time we could be having
if the girls were aboard!" lamented Ralph.
"Dance and play bridge all day, every day, with
no other fellows to cut in on us, and take them
away! I say, Jim, we might even come back
engaged if we had a chance like that!"</p>

<p>"Much more likely they'd be so sick of us
they'd never want to see us again!" returned
the other, shrewdly. "No&mdash;cruising's all right.
But I'd rather be in Green Falls if Linda and
Dot were with us."</p>

<p>"Maybe this will teach Linda a lesson,"
grumbled Ralph. Then he suddenly remembered
her job, with the Spraying Company in Atlanta.
He couldn't pretend to be sorry if she
lost it.</p>

<p>The speedy little yacht cruised all day along
the coast, while the men played bridge, and
smoked, and ate the most excellent meals,
cooked and served by an efficient staff. But underneath
all this comfort ran an under-current
of anxiety, especially towards evening, when
darkness came on, and no sign of the girls had
been seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Several airplanes had flown over their heads
during the day, and once they saw Ted's plane.
Dropping low, Louise waved her handkerchief,
which was the pre-arranged signal to tell them
that the flyers had found nothing, and Ralph
waved his in return, conveying the same information.
Should they have anything to report,
Ted announced that he would put his
plane through a series of stunts, and, in the
case of the yacht's making a discovery, Jim
Valier promised to climb up on the rail.</p>

<p>But the airplane and the yacht passed each
other with only a dismal fluttering of handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"Something's bound to happen tomorrow,"
said Jim, as he crawled into his bunk that night.
"It'll be the fourth of July!"</p>

<p>"By Jove! It will!" exclaimed Ralph. "We
ought to get some bang-up excitement!"</p>

<p>But the thing that happened was what they
had all been silently dreading&mdash;the fate which
only Louise had mentioned, that night in the
hotel sitting-room.</p>

<p class="pmb3">About noon&mdash;off the coast of Florida&mdash;Jim
Valier spotted an overturned old motor-boat,
bouncing helplessly about on the ocean!</p>

<i>On to Cuba</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>When the storm came at dawn on the thirtieth
of June, it awakened Linda first. As the
rain descended upon the slickers that covered
the girls, and upon their faces, Dot merely
buried her head sleepily under the raincoat,
but Linda sat bolt upright on the bed of leaves.</p>

<p>The wind was howling about the lonely island,
and the rain was pouring down in sheets. The
blackness of it all was terrifying, yet she knew
that she must get up.</p>

<p>"Dot!" she whispered, hoarsely. "Wake
up!"</p>

<p>Her companion opened her eyes sleepily as
she pushed the slicker aside.</p>

<p>"Yes.... Why Linda, it's&mdash;pouring!"</p>

<p>"It certainly is." Linda was slipping on her
shoes and her knickers over her pajamas.
"We've got to rescue the boat."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because water mustn't get into the gasoline.
And because the tide might come up high enough
to wash the boat out to sea."</p>

<p>"O.K.," replied Dot, now quite wide awake.
"I'm with you, Linda&mdash;in just a second."</p>

<p>Holding on to each other's hands, they made
their way with difficulty down to the beach
where the boat had been left, and together they
dragged it back and covered it with one of the
slickers.</p>

<p>Panting from the effort, they dropped back
on the sand and sat down, not bothering about
the rain that was descending relentlessly upon
them, soaking them to the skin.</p>

<p>"We might as well use the other slicker as a
roof for ourselves," suggested Dot, as she got
to her feet again. "We can hang it over some
bushes, and crawl under it."</p>

<p>"That's an idea!" approved Linda. "I was
wondering how one raincoat could keep us both
dry."</p>

<p>"It won't keep us dry&mdash;we're wet now. But
it will protect us from the worst force of this
cloud-burst."</p>

<p>They went back to their camping site and arranged
the slicker as best they could&mdash;carefully
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
putting the bag of money and the box of
tools under it, before they crawled in themselves.
The bushes were wet, and so was the
ground, but the girls were saved the discomfort
of having the rain actually pour in their faces.</p>

<p>They watched the storm for some time, hoping
that it would soon abate, and finally, becoming
drowsy, they fell asleep again, with
their feet sticking out under the covering.</p>

<p>Cramped by the awkward position, they
awakened in a couple of hours. Daylight had
arrived&mdash;but not sunlight. It was still raining
steadily and dismally.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose we can go today?" asked
Dot.</p>

<p>"Maybe later on," replied Linda, cheerfully.
"There's one thing good about this, Dot. We
can get a drink."</p>

<p>"How heavenly!" exclaimed the other, sitting
up. "But how do we manage it? We won't
get much by just opening our mouths!"</p>

<p>"Get up carefully. I'm sure there's a lot of
water lodging on the top of this slicker. Wait&mdash;get
the thermos bottles out of the tool-box first.
We'll use the cups, and then stand them up to
catch the rain as it falls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>Linda's surmise was correct; there was so
much water on the slicker that it was in danger
of collapsing any moment. They dipped their
cups into the pool and drank eagerly. How good
it tasted to their parched throats!</p>

<p>"There must be more down on the boat's
cover," suggested Dot. "Let's get it, and pour
it into our thermos bottles."</p>

<p>When they had carried out this idea, they
set the bottles firmly in the sand, and crept
back under cover.</p>

<p>"Shall we eat?" asked Dot, after watching
the rain for some minutes in silence.</p>

<p>"Let's wait a while&mdash;till noon, if we can.
We have only those two oranges and a half a
dozen crackers. It'll be something to look forward
to."</p>

<p>"There's still some tea and sugar&mdash;and one
can of milk," the other reminded her. "You
know we didn't use them, because we couldn't
afford the water. Now it'll be different."</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten all about that!" exclaimed
Linda, smiling. "Let's have tea and one cracker
for lunch, and save the oranges for supper."</p>

<p>"But how can we ever hope to build a fire
in this rain? We'd never find any dry sticks&mdash;and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
if we made one under here, we'd be
smoked out."</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that. But we can make
cold tea. If we leave the leaves in the water
long enough, they'll flavor it&mdash;anyway, that's
what I read in an ad one time."</p>

<p>"You think of everything, Linda! It's no
wonder you've gotten out of a dozen disasters
that would have killed an ordinary girl!"</p>

<p>"Now Dot!" protested the other girl, modestly.
"Just so long as we get out of this one,
I'll be satisfied."</p>

<p>To help pass the tediousness of the long
gloomy day, the girls took a brisk walk encircling
the entire island. Soaked as they were before
they started, they decided it would be
foolish to stop because of the rain. The sight
of the ocean, wild and angry as it was because
of the storm, aroused their wonder and admiration,
and rewarded them for their wet excursion.
In vain they squinted through the spyglasses
for a glimpse of the autogiro, but even
the island on which it had been left by Susie
was obliterated from their vision.</p>

<p>It was no wonder, therefore, that they did
not see the plane which brought Sergeant Worth
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
and the two pilots to that other island. All
unaware that Ladybug had flown home that
afternoon, the girls finally settled down after
dark to try to sleep under their improvised
roof.</p>

<p>When they awakened the following morning,
they were disappointed not to see the sun.
It was still raining, but no longer in torrents;
the storm had slackened to a monotonous
drizzle.</p>

<p>"We better go," said Linda, as they breakfasted
on tea and two crackers apiece. "I can
keep the engine pretty well covered up. And
this rain may keep up for days."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care to keep up this reducing
diet for days," observed Dot. "If we were only
too fat, Linda, how we would welcome such a
chance to starve ourselves!"</p>

<p>"Yes.... If&mdash;Oh, Dot, don't you wish we
had a thick steak now&mdash;smothered in mushrooms&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With creamed potatoes and fresh peas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fruit salad and cheese wafers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meringues, salted nuts, and coffee!"</p>

<p>Both girls suddenly laughed out loud.</p>

<p>"Anyway, we can both have our drinks of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
water," concluded Dot. "And they say thirst
is worse than hunger."</p>

<p>"We'll fill both thermos bottles before we
push off," said Linda. "But I'm counting on
reaching the Ladybug before noon, and then
we ought to get to the Georgia coast by two
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Where we eat that dinner!" added Dot.</p>

<p>Carrying their belongings, they walked down
to the beach in their rain-soaked clothing, and
pushed the boat out towards the water. The
ocean was still so high and so rough that Linda
hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"Do you think we can make it?" asked Dot,
noticing the expression of doubt on her companion's
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. That island didn't look far,
yesterday."</p>

<p>"That's true. But I can't see it now, Linda.
Suppose the storm had washed the Ladybug
away&mdash;or even the whole island?"</p>

<p>Linda shuddered, realizing that there was
that possibility. She took the glasses from her
pocket, and peered through them in the direction
she remembered the island to be.</p>

<p>"I can't see a thing but ocean," she stated.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
"The waves are so high. But let's go in that
direction anyway. It must be there."</p>

<p>She turned to the motor-boat and attempted
to start the engine, but for some minutes she
labored in vain, for the engine refused to catch.
Was everything in the world against them,
Dot silently wondered, as she watched Linda
repeat her efforts with infinite patience.</p>

<p>At last, however, there was a sputter, and
the motor started. The girls pushed the boat
into the water and climbed into it.</p>

<p>It would have been great sport riding the
waves, had it not been for the grave danger
attached. This was no sporting contest, with a
life-guard in readiness to rescue them if anything
went wrong! It was a race between life
and death.</p>

<p>The wind had died down, however, and the
sea was gradually growing calmer. Up and
down the little boat bobbed, now in the trough
of a wave, seemingly under a mountain of water&mdash;now
rising again to a height that made the
girls think of a scenic-railway at a pleasure
park. Dot screamed with excitement, but Linda's
lips were set in a firm line of determination,
her attention riveted on the engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>By some miracle, it seemed to the girls, the
little boat forged triumphantly ahead, with its
motor running smoothly. A feeling of confidence
was gradually taking the place of fear, and Dot
strained her eyes for the island that was their
goal. Half an hour later she spotted it, and
almost upset the boat in her joy.</p>

<p>"There it is, Linda!" she cried, excitedly.
"Oh, Linda, we're saved! We're&mdash;&mdash;" She
stopped suddenly, hardly able to believe her
eyes. The autogiro was gone!</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Dot?" asked Linda, unable
to understand the abrupt end of her chum's
rejoicing. "Anything wrong!"</p>

<p>"Yes.... The Ladybug's gone!"</p>

<p>"What? Oh, it can't be!" Linda's voice was
hoarse with terror. "Look again, Dot&mdash;you have
the glasses."</p>

<p>Dot squinted her eyes, but was rewarded by
no trace of the plane.</p>

<p>"You take a look, Linda," she suggested.
"Maybe you can see better."</p>

<p>The other girl eagerly caught the glasses
which her companion tossed, and with trembling
fingers held them to her eyes. The island
was in plain sight now, but it was a ghastly
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
fact that the autogiro had completely disappeared.</p>

<p>Linda continued to gaze at the barren spot,
her eyes fixed and staring, as if she were looking
at death itself. Then, dropping the glasses
into her lap, she seemed to be thinking intently.</p>

<p>"It's true, Dot," she said, in an expressionless
tone. "Yet that must be the right island....
Something has happened.... I don't
know whether the wind could have lifted the
Ladybug&mdash;or whether that gangster came back
for it.... In any case, there's only one thing
for us to do."</p>

<p>"Yes?" faltered Dot, biting her lips to keep
back the tears. She must not fail Linda now,
in her darkest hour.</p>

<p>"Turn the boat around, and make for the
shore. We mustn't waste another drop of gasoline.
It&mdash;won't last forever."</p>

<p>"Shall we go back to our island&mdash;if we can
find it?" asked Dot, as she turned the wheel.</p>

<p>"No, we'll go straight west.... Or is that
the west? Oh, if we only had a compass, or the
sun to guide us.... But that must be the right
direction."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Linda was speaking bravely, trying to keep
her voice normal, and her companion took heart
from her manner. The boat went forward in
the opposite direction, presumably towards the
coast.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed in silence, each girl intent
upon her task. Linda took out her extra
can of gasoline and filled the tank. Once Dot
drank some water from the thermos bottle and
reminded Linda of hers. All the while they continued
to keep a sharp look-out for the coast.</p>

<p>Another hour passed, and the girls' hunger
began to assault them. The rain continued to
fall, and weariness stole over them both. They
were too weak and too tired to talk.</p>

<p>At last Linda broke the silence by asking
Dot to take another good look for the coast
through the glasses. She did not add that it
was vital this time, that the gasoline was running
very low. On a rough sea like this, oars
would be out of the question, even if the girls
had been as strong as boys.</p>

<p>"I can't see anything but water," was the
reply.</p>

<p>But just at that moment Linda saw something
that held her speechless with terror. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
boat was springing a leak! Water appeared to
be pouring in by the bucket-full!</p>

<p>As the significance of this catastrophe
dawned upon Linda, her throat grew dry and
parched; the words with which she meant to
tell Dot choked her so that she could not speak.
How, oh how could she possibly inform her
brave chum of what was literally their death
sentence!</p>

<p>It was Dot, however, who spoke instead.
Rather, she cried out hysterically,</p>

<p>"Linda, I see a boat! A steam-boat! Coming
towards us!"</p>

<p>"Where?" gasped the other girl, her heart
beating wildly between hope and fear.</p>

<p>"Right ahead! Look! You can see her without
the glasses now!"</p>

<p>Linda shot a swift glance at the approaching
boat, then looked again at the floor, where the
water was fast deepening. Would the rescue
come in time? And would the boat stop at their
signal of distress?</p>

<p>Wild with excitement, both girls raised their
arms and waved desperately at the approaching
craft, until it was only fifty yards away. Then
they both shouted with a power and volume
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
that they would not have believed they possessed.</p>

<p>The oncoming boat decreased its speed until
it was almost beside the girls' sinking craft.
To their overwhelming joy and relief, they saw
that it was stopping. A man appeared on the
deck, and called to them in a pleasant voice.</p>

<p>"In trouble, girls?"</p>

<p>"Our boat's sinking!" shouted Linda to Dot's
amazement, for the latter was still unaware of
the immediate tragedy that was threatening
them. "Can you take us aboard?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" he replied. "Wait till I get a rope
ladder."</p>

<p>While he was gone, Linda pointed to the
water in the boat, which by this time Dot had
seen, and signaled to the other girl to say
nothing of their experiences to this man, until
they learned more about him. Linda's recent
association with criminals had made her exceedingly
wary.</p>

<p>"Pull up closer," instructed the man, as he
returned with the ladder. "Now, can you
climb?"</p>

<p>"Easily!" Dot assured him. "We're in
knickers, anyhow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"May we throw our stuff on board first?"
inquired Linda, picking up the bag which contained,
besides their few possessions, all the
bank's money.</p>

<p>"Sure! Anything breakable in it?"</p>

<p>"Only a couple of mirrors," returned Dot,
who had regained her cheerfulness with amazing
speed. "And we're not afraid of bad luck,"
she added.</p>

<p>A moment later the girls climbed to safety,
and pressed their rescuer's hand in gratitude.
It seemed like a miracle to them both, and the
old seaman was like an angel from heaven.</p>

<p>"How soon will we get to the coast?" asked
Linda eagerly.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"We can't go to the coast," he replied.
"We're headed for Cuba."</p>

<p>"But we must get back as soon as possible,"
pleaded Linda, beginning to wonder whether
she was about to be kidnapped again.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"You were headed for the open ocean," the
seaman informed her, to both girls' consternation.
"And that's where we have to go. I can't
stop at the United States.... I'm awfully
sorry...."</p>

<i>Luck for Ted and Louise</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Linda and Dot stood still on the deck of the
old boat, grasping the rail with their hands,
and looking intently at their rescuer. He was a
typical old seaman, with tanned, roughened
face, a gray beard, and kindly blue eyes.</p>

<p>"That was a narrow escape," he remarked.
"What do you girls mean by going out on a
rough sea like this, in a shell like you had?"</p>

<p>"We couldn't help it," Linda replied. "And
we thought the boat was safe. We didn't know
it was going to spring a leak.... Would it
take very long to run us to the coast, Mr.&mdash;Captain&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Smallweed," supplied the man. "And everybody
calls me 'Cap'n'."</p>

<p>"Well, would it, Captain Smallweed?" repeated
Linda, amused at the name. He ought
to be at home on the island they had just come
from, she thought&mdash;there were so many "small
weeds" growing there!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Too long fer me to stop," he replied, to
the girls' dismay. "I got to get back to my
family, in Havana." His blue eyes twinkled.
"Why? What have you girls got in that bag,
that's so important to deliver in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"You think we're boot-leggers!" laughed
Dot. "Don't you, Captain?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be surprised at anything," he
answered, smiling. "I've seen just as nice
lookin' girls as you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're not very nice looking,"
sighed Linda, surveying their drenched, bedraggled
clothing. "But we're really not boot-leggers....
We want to get back so that we
can telephone to our families. They probably
think that storm was the end of us."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry, but I can't go off my course.
Like to, if I had the time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't, you can't&mdash;that's all
there is to it," said Linda, philosophically.
"We're glad to be alive at all, and I don't
suppose a couple of days will make any difference."</p>

<p>"How long do you think it will take you to
get to Cuba?" put in Dot anxiously. There was
no use fussing, of course, but she could not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
forget that her mother and father would be
frantic by this time.</p>

<p>"I'm reckonin' on dockin' at Havana the
fourth of July. This is only the first, but these
are stormy seas, and we have to expect delays....
Now come on inside, out o' this
drizzle. You girls are drenched&mdash;I'll have to
give you the only cabin I got. To get yourselves
dry in."</p>

<p>Stooping over, he picked up Linda's tool-box,
and finding it heavy, eyed it suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You girls gangsters?" he asked, unexpectedly.
"Got any guns on you?"</p>

<p>Both girls felt themselves growing red at this
accusation, yet they could not deny it wholly.</p>

<p>"That box has the tools in it which I used
to fix up the engine of the motor-boat," Linda
finally explained. "And you can take our word
that we're not gangsters."</p>

<p>But they were exceedingly nervous as they
followed the Captain to the cabin where there
were two bunks, one on top of the other. Suppose
he should decide to search them&mdash;and find
not only the two revolvers, but all that money
besides! He would never believe their story!</p>

<p>"When you get dry, I'll take you over the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
whole boat," he said. "I carry tobacco up the
coast every couple of months. Used to have a
sail-boat&mdash;that was the real thing! But this
little lady's speedy&mdash;and better in a storm like
we just had."</p>

<p>"How can we ever thank you enough, Captain
Smallweed?" cried Dot, suddenly overwhelmed
by a sense of gratitude for their safety.
"Our fathers will send you a handsome reward
when we get back home."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," smiled the man. "I've
got a girl of my own&mdash;she's married now&mdash;but
she's still a kid to me, and I know how I'd want
her treated.... Now, you can bolt this door
if you want to, so there won't be any danger of
either of the two other fellows aboard coming
in accidentally&mdash;and you can get yourselves
dry."</p>

<p>"There's&mdash;there's just one thing, Captain,"
stammered Linda. "We're dreadfully hungry.
Could we have a piece of bread, or anything to
eat?"</p>

<p>"You poor kids!" he exclaimed, in a fatherly
tone. "Come on down to the kitchen, and
you can help yourselves."</p>

<p>Though the food he provided was not the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
steak dinner they had been dreaming about on
the island, it tasted good to those two starved
girls. Captain Smallweed made tea for them,
and brought out bread and smoked sausages,
and Linda and Dot ate every crumb of the
repast.</p>

<p>"We were marooned on an island during
that storm," Linda explained. "And we have
had nothing but a couple of oranges and a few
crackers for two days."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll get a good supper," the Captain
promised them. "That's why I'm not givin'
you more now. I'll knock on your door about
eight o'clock, if you ain't awake before then.
That's when we usually eat."</p>

<p>When the girls were finally alone in their
cabin, they gazed first at their bag of money,
then at each other, and suddenly started to
laugh. It was such a ridiculous situation. During
those lonely days of exile on the island
they had pictured their return so differently.
It would be a grand occasion, with exciting
telephone calls to their families, a marvelous
dinner at a hotel, perhaps a radio broadcast
of their safe landing! Instead of all that, here
they were, stowed away in a shabby boat, suspected
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of crime, and feasting on stale bread
and hot dogs for their banquet! Worst of all
there would be three weary days of waiting before
informing the world of their safety! Yet
they were thankful indeed that they had been
rescued at all, and by a man as kind-hearted
as the old sea captain.</p>

<p>"I don't really think he'll bother any more
about that bag," said Linda, as she took off
her wet shoes. "If only we can get it back to
Jacksonville safely, from Cuba! If we only had
the Ladybug!"</p>

<p>"It's a mystery where she could have vanished
to," observed Dot. "But I suppose that
is a small thing, compared to saving our lives."</p>

<p>"You'll never go anywhere with me again,"
sighed Linda. "Dot!" she exclaimed abruptly,
"I'd forgotten all about my job!"</p>

<p>"I hadn't forgotten I was to start back North
today," remarked the other girl. "Jim Valier
was going to motor over and meet me at the
station when my train came in."</p>

<p>"Poor Jim!" sighed Linda, little thinking
that the young man had no intention of doing
that. "He'll have a good wait. But Jim can always
sleep, on any occasion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess he won't expect me.... We must
be reported as missing by now&mdash;in all the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Of course. I'd forgotten...."</p>

<p>The girls wrapped themselves in blankets and
slept the rest of the afternoon, to waken in
time to see the sun, which had appeared at
last, just setting over the sea. Their clothing
was still damp and disheveled, but they put it
on and went up on deck to hunt their benefactor.</p>

<p>"We want you to let us cook," announced
Dot, as she spied him. "We insist on making
ourselves useful."</p>

<p>The man smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"All right," he agreed. "You can&mdash;tomorrow.
But supper's ready now. Come on down."</p>

<p>They followed the Captain into the kitchen,
where another man was placing a dish of potatoes
on the wooden table, which did not boast
of a cover.</p>

<p>"Meet Steve, ladies," her said&mdash;"my friend
the pilot."</p>

<p>The girls nodded, and Dot asked, with anxiety,
"But who's guiding the boat now, while
Mr. Steve eats his supper?"</p>

<p>Both men laughed at her concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's another one besides us. He takes
his turn, and so do I. We never all three eat
or sleep at the same time."</p>

<p>It was a merry meal, though an exceedingly
greasy one of fried potatoes and underdone
bacon. The coffee, too, was none too good&mdash;for
it was weak and muddy-looking. Nevertheless,
both girls praised the supper extravagantly,
for it tasted good to them, but they inwardly
resolved to show the men the next day
how food ought to be cooked.</p>

<p>The next two days passed pleasantly enough,
for the girls were able to busy themselves with
the meals, and the men's appreciation was
plenty of reward for their efforts. In their off
hours they relaxed by watching the ocean and
scanning the sky for airplanes, the make of
which Linda could often guess. Sometimes they
played checkers with each other, or with Captain
Smallweed, to the latter's delight. But
never again was the suspicious-looking tool-box
mentioned, until Linda herself handed it over
to Steve, saying that she did not want to bother
to take it to Havana.</p>

<p>By the time July third arrived, their boat
was well out of the range of the yacht that was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
cruising in search of them, and on July fourth&mdash;the
day that Jim Valier spotted the overturned
motor-boat early in the morning&mdash;Captain
Smallweed docked safely at Cuba.</p>

<p>"Where do you girls want to go now?" asked
the Captain, as the party stepped ashore.
"Want to come along home with me, and meet
the wife? She can rig you up in some decent
clothes."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," replied Linda, "but
we want to get to a telephone as soon as possible,
so that we can get in touch with our families.
So if you would just get us a taxi, and
send us to the best hotel in Havana&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In those rigs?" inquired the other, in
amazement. "Everybody will stare at you! They
dress well in Cuba, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're past caring about appearances,"
laughed Linda. "So stop that taxi for us, will
you please, Captain?... And thank you a
thousand times for all you have done for us."</p>

<p>"You'll hear from our fathers soon," added
Dot, as she too shook hands with the old man.</p>

<p>Cautiously protecting the bag, into which
Linda had stuffed the revolvers under the
money, the girls taxied to the best hotel in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
city. The driver eyed them suspiciously, and
the clerk at the desk stared at them as if they
were hoboes. But he condescended to assign
them a room when they showed evidence of paying
in advance.</p>

<p>"We want a long-distance wire first of all,"
announced Linda. "We'd like to telephone from
our rooms&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, for two slender arms
were suddenly thrust about her neck, and kisses
were being pressed violently upon her lips and
cheeks. Louise Mackay stood behind them!
Louise, with her husband, both in flyers' suits.</p>

<p>Try as she could, the girl could not utter a
word. The tears ran down her cheeks, and she
continued to kiss first Linda and then Dot in
the wildest ecstasy.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it!" she said at last. "Is it
really, truly you, Linda darling?"</p>

<p>"What's left of us," replied Linda, laughing.
"Did you ever see two such sights as we
are?"</p>

<p>"I never saw anyone or anything in my life
that looked half so good to me!" returned
Louise, fervently. She stepped back and laid
her hand on her husband's arm, for so far Ted
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
had not had a chance to say anything, or be
included in the welcome. "Tell me it's true,
Ted&mdash;that I'm not dreaming!" she urged. "I
simply can't believe it."</p>

<p>"It's the best, the truest thing in the world,"
the young man assured her.</p>

<p>"We were positive you were dead," Louise
explained. "We had so much evidence to prove
it&mdash;the empty island where you were marooned,
the overturned motor-boat that Jim Valier
spotted early this morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jim Valier!" repeated Dot, in amazement.
"Where would Jim see our old boat?"</p>

<p>"Jim and Ralph and your two fathers are
on a yacht, searching for you. They broadcast
by radio any news they get. And Ted and I
have flown to every island anywhere near the
coast. We finished searching them all, so we
landed here this morning, just for a rest."</p>

<p>"Then you have a plane!" cried Linda, in
delight. "You can take us back to Florida!
I'd so hate to get into another boat&mdash;I simply
loathe the sight of them."</p>

<p>"Do tell us what happened to you," urged
Ted. "I don't understand how we missed you
everywhere."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a pretty long story," replied Dot. "I
think we better phone our families first. They
must be almost crazy."</p>

<p>"They are," agreed Ted. "You go up in
your room and phone them while I go to a radio
station and broadcast the news."</p>

<p class="pmb3">"And I'll tell you what I'll do in the meanwhile,"
offered Louise. "I'll go out and buy
you some decent clothing!"</p>

<i>The Return</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>Until the second of July, Linda's aunt, Miss
Emily Carlton, had managed, with Mrs. Crowley's
help, to keep hoping that the girls were
still alive. Then her brother's long-distance call
from Jacksonville, informing her that he was
going to sea in a yacht in search of Linda and
Dot confirmed all the fears she was secretly
cherishing. That night she collapsed and went
to bed a nervous wreck.</p>

<p>After once mentioning the fact that Linda
was still reported missing in the newspapers,
Miss Carlton's housekeeper learned not to speak
of the girl again. It seemed as if the older
woman could not bear to talk about her niece;
in the few days since her disappearance she
had aged rapidly. She lay listlessly on her bed,
not seeing anyone, not even her dear friend
Mrs. Crowley.</p>

<p>It was about noon on the fourth of July that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the telephone operator informed the housekeeper
that Havana was calling Miss Carlton. The
good woman replied that her mistress was sick
in bed, and that she would take the message
for her. Her hands trembled as she awaited
what she believed would be the announcement
of Linda's death.</p>

<p>Faint and far off came the astounding words:
"Aunt Emily, this is Linda."</p>

<p>"Wait!" cried the woman, shaking as if she
had heard a ghost. "I'll get your aunt, Miss
Linda."</p>

<p>Rushing to the bed-room, she handed Miss
Carlton the bed-side telephone.</p>

<p>"It's Miss Linda," she whispered.</p>

<p>Doubting her senses, the patient sat up and
took the instrument.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Darling Aunt Emily! It's Linda!" was the
almost unbelievable reply at the other end of
the wire.</p>

<p>Miss Carlton sobbed; she could not say a
word.</p>

<p>"Aunt Emily? Are you there?" demanded
the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;dear! Oh, are you all right? Not
hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Dot and I are both fine&mdash;she's
talking to her mother now. We're&mdash;in Cuba."</p>

<p>"Cuba!" repeated the startled woman. "I
thought it was the Okefenokee Swamp, or the
Atlantic Ocean! Your father and Mr. Crowley
are looking for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Ted and Louise are here, and
Ted's broadcasting the news of our safe arrival
now.... Probably Daddy has heard by
this time."</p>

<p>"When will you be home, dear?" inquired
Miss Carlton.</p>

<p>"Soon, I hope.... But we have to stop in
Jacksonville first.... Aunt Emily, couldn't
you and Mrs. Crowley come to Jacksonville?
We're just dying to see you!"</p>

<p>Miss Carlton considered; she hated to tell
Linda that she was sick in bed. But wait&mdash;was
she? Wasn't it only nerves after all? Why, this
good news made her feel like a different person!</p>

<p>"All right, dear," she agreed. "If Mrs. Crowley
will, I'll try to arrange it. Shall I send a
wire?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," replied Linda. "To Captain Magee,
at the City Hall, Jacksonville. I'll be there in
a day or so.... Now good-by, dear Auntie!"</p>

<p>While Linda waited for Dot to come back
from her call, which the latter had put in from
another instrument, she opened the bag and
took out their few possessions that were covering
the money. They must be very careful not
to let anything happen to all that wealth, she
thought&mdash;they must never go out of the room
and leave it, if only for a minute. How dreadful
it would be if it were stolen now, after they had
successfully brought it through all their dangerous
adventures!</p>

<p>Dot returned in a couple of minutes, and the
girls got ready to enjoy the luxury of a real
bath, in a real tub. How good the warm water
felt, how wonderful the big, soft bath towels!
They spent an hour bathing and washing their
hair, and trying to make their nails presentable
with Louise's manicure set.</p>

<p>They had scarcely finished when the latter
returned, followed by a porter carrying innumerable
boxes and packages in his arms.</p>

<p>"I've bought everything for you from the
skin out," she announced gayly, as she put the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
load on the floor. "Even hats and shoes, though
I knew I was taking a chance at them. But I
remembered that you and I often wore each other's
things at school, Linda, and I judged that
Dot would wear a size smaller. I do hope you
can wear them, just till you get to your trunks
at Jacksonville."</p>

<p>"You're an angel, Lou!" cried Linda, excited
at the prospect of looking clean and respectable
again.</p>

<p>"See if you like them," urged Louise. "I
got a blue dress for you, Linda, to match your
eyes&mdash;and a pink one for Dot."</p>

<p>"To match my eyes?" teased the latter.</p>

<p>All three girls began immediately to untie
the packages, and drew out the purchases one
after another with exclamations of admiration.
Dot said that she was so used to seeing dirty
knickers that she had positively forgotten what
dainty clothing looked like.</p>

<p>"Well, hurry up and dress!" urged Louise.
"We want to eat lunch in about ten minutes.
Ted means to take off at two o'clock, if you girls
think you can be ready by then."</p>

<p>"We surely can!" cried Linda, joyfully. She
couldn't wait to get back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll burn your old stuff, won't you?"
asked Louise. "This bag's a sight, too&mdash;why
not stuff your old clothing into it, and ask the
porter to take it away!"</p>

<p>Linda and Dot let out a wild cry of protest
at the same moment, and the other girl
frowned.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered Linda. "That bag has
thousands of dollars in it. Belonging to the
Jacksonville bank."</p>

<p>"Oh! You really have that money? And kept
it all this time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But don't say a word about it out loud.
We'll take it with us into the dining-room, and
wear our new hats, so nobody will think it
queer."</p>

<p>They found Ted in the lobby of the hotel as
they got out of the elevator, and they went into
the dining-room to order the meal that Linda
and Dot had been longing for on the island.
It tasted good to them, but not so good, they
had to admit, as the sausages and stale bread
and hot tea which Captain Smallweed provided,
when they were almost starved.</p>

<p>It was during the meal that they pieced the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
story together. Linda began by telling of the
finding of the money in the bags and the discovery
of the last member of the gang on the
island.</p>

<p>"But why he ran away without shooting us
is a mystery to us," put in Dot.</p>

<p>"He thought that you had armed policemen
with you," explained Louise. "We learned that
later from Susie. She was captured a couple of
days ago&mdash;in Panama."</p>

<p>"Where is she now?" demanded Linda, excitedly.</p>

<p>"In jail, of course."</p>

<p>"And the man they called the 'Doc'?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Ted. "Unfortunately he got
away&mdash;fled the country. Lucky you girls got
hold of the money, or the bank would never
have seen it again.... And by the way, there's
a big reward&mdash;ten thousand dollars, I believe."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand dollars!" repeated Dot, in
amazement. "What do you think of that,
Linda?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" cried the latter, joyously.
"Five thousand apiece. Well, I'm glad you're
going to get something out of this dreadful experience,
Dot&mdash;that I selfishly dragged you into.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
And my part will go towards a new autogiro."</p>

<p>"A new autogiro!" exclaimed Louise, in surprise.
"You don't need one, Linda. The Ladybug's
safe and sound&mdash;at the Jacksonville airport."</p>

<p>"What? You mean that?" Linda seized the
other girl's hand in almost incredulous rapture.
"How did it get there?"</p>

<p>"The police found it that day it stormed so.
And a pilot flew it back to Jacksonville."</p>

<p>Linda and Dot gazed at each other in full
realization at last of the mysterious disappearance
of the plane which they had mourned as
lost forever.</p>

<p>If Linda was eager to get back to Jacksonville
before, she was doubly so now. She could
hardly contain her excitement during that flight
across the Gulf of Mexico and over the state of
Florida to the northern part. She kept urging
Ted to put on more speed, to let the motor out
to its limit, but the young man, realizing the
load he was carrying, was not to be tempted
beyond his better judgment.</p>

<p>They arrived at Jacksonville just as it was
growing dusk, and flew over the city, now so
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
familiar to them all, to the airport on its outskirts.
Gracefully the skillful pilot swooped
down the field to his landing.</p>

<p>The usual number of employees came out to
greet them, but hardly had the girls climbed
out of the plane when a resounding shout went
up over the field. Linda Carlton and Dorothy
Crowley had been recognized!</p>

<p>A crowd collected immediately, a crowd that
had been prepared by Ted's radio message that
afternoon, to welcome the two popular girls
back to civilization. It was all that Linda and
Dot could do to wave and shout greetings in
return.</p>

<p>"I just want one look at my Ladybug," said
Linda. "If you good people will let me get
through&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this request, an accommodating official
picked her right up on his shoulder, and carried
her, amid the laughter of the crowd, triumphantly
to the hangar where the autogiro
was housed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear Ladybug!" whispered Linda,
not wanting anyone to think she was silly, but
so overcome with joy that she had to say something.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
No one but a pilot could understand the
genuine affection which she felt for her autogiro.</p>

<p>"I'll be over to fly you tomorrow," she added,
under her breath. Then, turning to the man who
had conducted her across the field, she asked
him whether he could as easily take her to the
waiting taxi-cab.</p>

<p>They were off at last, waving and smiling to
the enthusiastic crowd.</p>

<p>"Be sure to stay in Jacksonville till Saturday,"
the people begged them. "We're going
to celebrate for you then!"</p>

<p>The girls nodded, and the taxi driver sped
away with orders to go straight to the City Hall.</p>

<p>Captain Magee, who had received a call from
the airport, was ready and waiting for them.
Ted carried the shabby, worn bag into his
office, and Linda put it into the Captain's hands
herself.</p>

<p>"The bank's money," she explained. "And
the two revolvers. We never had to use them
at all."</p>

<p>"But we'd have died without them," added
Dot. "Of fright&mdash;if nothing else."</p>

<p>In vain Captain Magee tried to tell the girls
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
how wonderfully brave he thought they had
been, but he was so overcome by feeling that
he groped for words and stammered&mdash;ending
by pressing both Linda's and Dot's hands in
silence.</p>

<p>"Two young girls like you&mdash;" he finally managed
to say&mdash;"succeeding where the police and
everybody else failed! Capturing a hundred
thousand dollars by a clever trick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is there really that much?" inquired Dot.
"Of course we never counted it."</p>

<p>The officer smiled at their unconcern. In spite
of all their ability, they still seemed like children
to him.</p>

<p>"By the way, Miss Carlton," he said, "I had
a wire from your aunt this afternoon. She will
arrive in Jacksonville Saturday morning&mdash;accompanied
by Mrs. Crowley."</p>

<p>This final piece of good news was just what
the girls needed to complete their perfect day.
Their eyes lighted up with happiness, and they
squeezed each other's hands in joy.</p>

<p>"And your fathers ought to be back tomorrow.
I'll send them straight to the hotel," he
added. "So don't go away."</p>

<p>"Wild horses couldn't drag us!" returned
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Linda. "We're just dying to see them....
Now, good-by, Captain Magee.... We must
go and get some dinner."</p>

<p class="pmb3">So, back in the hotel in Jacksonville, Dot
Crowley and Linda Carlton spent their first
enjoyable evening for a week&mdash;celebrating their
safe return with their dear friends, the Mackays.</p>

<i>Conclusion</i></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />


<p>The girls' first visitor the following day was
not, as they had hoped, the party from the
yacht, but a woman.</p>

<p>"Who can it be?" demanded Dot, for the
clerk at the desk had not sent up a name with
the message.</p>

<p>"A reporter, probably," yawned Linda.
"They'll be hot on our trail now, Dot. That was
one good thing about the island&mdash;we didn't have
to read newspapers or give interviews."</p>

<p>"You're not wishing you were back again?"</p>

<p>"Never!" affirmed Linda, surveying the
breakfast tray which she and Dot had been
luxuriously enjoying. "I don't care for cold
tea and crackers as a steady diet."</p>

<p>"But what shall we do about this visitor?"
persisted her companion. "The clerk's still
waiting for our reply."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, tell him to send her up, I suppose. After
all, the poor girls have to earn a living."</p>

<p>As Dot gave the message over the telephone,
Linda surveyed the room with a frown of distaste.</p>

<p>"It's not so neat, Dot&mdash;to receive a caller,"
she remarked. "Maybe we ought to have gone
downstairs."</p>

<p>"Think I better try to call him back?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess it's too late now&mdash;the girl's
probably on the elevator by this time. Anyhow,
it really doesn't matter. Newspaper women are
usually awfully good sports."</p>

<p>To their amazement and chagrin, it was not
a reporter to whom, a moment later, Dot opened
the door. A beautifully dressed woman stood before
them, smiling nervously. It was Mrs. Carter&mdash;Jackson
Carter's mother!</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mrs. Carter!" exclaimed
Dot. "Do come in&mdash;if you can pardon the appearance
of this room."</p>

<p>The older woman seemed scarcely to notice
the unmade beds or the open trunks. She nodded
to Linda as she entered, but she appeared
like a person with something serious on her
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you know where to find us?" inquired
Dot, after she had cleared a chair for
their visitor.</p>

<p>"It's in all the papers," the latter replied.
"Haven't you read about yourselves? Why,
everybody in town thinks you two girls are
simply marvelous! Rescuing that money was a
miracle in itself&mdash;an act of courage that Jacksonville
will always be grateful to you for."</p>

<p>"It's awfully nice of you to say so," murmured
Dot, for Linda remained silent. Somehow
the latter could never feel at home with
this woman.</p>

<p>"Our city is planning a parade and celebration
in your honor," she continued. "And the
Daughters of the Confederacy would like to invite
you to a dinner and reception afterwards.
That is one of the reasons why I came to see
you&mdash;to extend the invitation in person."</p>

<p>"It's extremely kind of you," assented Dot.
"We'll be delighted to accept, won't we, Linda?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;of course&mdash;only&mdash;" Linda
paused, hoping that she was not appearing rude.</p>

<p>"Except what, my dear!" asked Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>"Well, it's marvelous of you to do it for us,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
but you see our fathers are coming&mdash;and Dot's
mother&mdash;and my Aunt Emily&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they are included, of course! There
will be both men and women at the banquet,
and my brother-in-law, the president of the bank
that was robbed, hopes to present you girls with
the reward."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's going to be great fun, Linda!" exclaimed
Dot, excitedly. "We've just got to be
there!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it will be charming," agreed the other
girl. "We'll be delighted to come&mdash;if we may
bring our friends."</p>

<p>There seemed nothing more to say, yet Mrs.
Carter made no move towards going. To fill an
awkward pause, Dot inquired how Jackson was.</p>

<p>"Jackson has been away since the first of
July," replied the older woman. "I haven't
heard anything from him, and I am quite anxious,
though he warned me he couldn't write.
He and his chum, Hal Perry, went into the
Okefenokee Swamp to search for you girls."</p>

<p>"The Okefenokee Swamp!" repeated Linda.
It seemed ages since she had been lost in that
desolate expanse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. And I wondered, Miss Carlton, whether
you would be willing to fly up to the northern
end, up towards Camp Cordelia, and look for
them. Oh, I don't mean go into the swamp again&mdash;that
would be too dreadful&mdash;but just fly
around it."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," agreed Linda, not knowing
what else to say. "If you will let me wait until
my Daddy comes, so I can take him with me."</p>

<p>"Naturally!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter rose at last, but she still appeared
to be embarrassed.</p>

<p>"There is something else I want to say to
you, Miss Carlton. An apology, this time. I
know now that you are the same girl my son
rescued in the swamp and brought home to our
house. The girl to whom I was so rude.... I&mdash;I
want to beg your pardon."</p>

<p>It was a great deal from a woman of Mrs.
Carter's dignity and importance, and Linda was
deeply touched.</p>

<p>"This is very sweet of you, Mrs. Carter,"
she said. "And of course I understand how you
felt at the time. I'm only too glad to forget all
about it.... And," she added, holding out her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
hand, "I'll go to your son's rescue, as he has
twice gone to mine&mdash;as soon as my Daddy
comes."</p>

<p>Still the visitor hesitated, even after she had
shaken hands with both the girls, and had
reached the doorway.</p>

<p>"Would you girls consider bringing your
families out to our home, to spend the weekend
with us?" she asked, more as one seeking
than as one bestowing a favor.</p>

<p>Dot did not answer this time; she looked inquiringly
at Linda.</p>

<p>"It would be lovely," replied the latter, with
genuine enthusiasm. "But I am afraid there are
too many of us. You see there are two friends
with us now&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Mackay, who picked
us up in Havana&mdash;and there are two more with
our fathers on the yacht. With my aunt and
Dot's mother, it will make ten in all. And that is
too big a crowd for any place but a hotel!"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" protested Mrs. Carter. "I
should love it. We have plenty of room, and
plenty of servants&mdash;and we enjoy house-parties.
How I shall look forward to seeing your mother,
Dorothy!... You will come, won't you, girls&mdash;as
soon as the whole party is together?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>With such a pressing invitation as this, they
could not do otherwise than graciously accept,
and, satisfied at last, Mrs. Carter bade them
good-by.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to discuss this
unexpected visit, for no sooner had this caller
departed than others began to arrive. Louise
dashed into the room on her return from breakfasting
with Ted in the dining-room, and before
Dot and Linda could repeat the invitation to
her, news came that the yachting party had
arrived.</p>

<p>The reunion of the two girls with their
fathers was touching to see. For some minutes
they clung to one another in the lobby of the
hotel, regardless of the strangers about. Ralph
Clavering and Jim Valier stood in the background,
unnoticed.</p>

<p>About three o'clock that afternoon Linda suddenly
remembered her promise to Mrs. Carter
in regard to flying over the Okefenokee
Swamp in search of Jackson, and she suggested
to her father that they go to the airport
immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlton shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, daughter," he said. "You will never
have my consent again to fly within fifty miles
of that dismal swamp!"</p>

<p>"But we must be within fifty miles of it
now," returned Linda. "Shall we leave Jacksonville?"</p>

<p>"Now, Linda! You know what I mean."</p>

<p>"But how shall I tell Mrs. Carter? I promised,
you know."</p>

<p>"You can leave that to me," he replied.
"I'll explain."</p>

<p>But it was not necessary to do this, for the
woman telephoned herself almost immediately
to say that the boys had arrived by automobile
half an hour ago. She concluded by reminding
Linda that she was expecting the whole party
the following day for luncheon.</p>

<p>Saturday dawned clear and bright, and the
parade was scheduled for the early morning,
before the sun's rays became blistering. Linda
and Dot occupied seats of honor on the canopied
grandstand, beside the Mayor, and they bowed
and smiled to everyone that passed by.</p>

<p class="pmb3 pmb2">Miss Carlton and Mrs. Crowley arrived just
in time to witness the demonstration, in honor
of their two brave girls.</p>
